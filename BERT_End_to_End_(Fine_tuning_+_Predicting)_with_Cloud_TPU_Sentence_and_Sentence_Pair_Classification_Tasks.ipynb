This means the number of people who choose the public option will increase. This also means the number of people chipped will be plentiful as well. The adults who choose to have a chip implanted are the lucky (yes, lucky if you're a Govt Control Libtard) ones in this case. Children who are \"born in the United States who at the time of birth is not otherwise covered under acceptable coverage\" will be qualified and placed into the CHIP or Children's Health Insurance Program (what a convenient name). With a name like CHIP it would seem consistent to have the chip implanted into a child.

opportunity for many more American people to get a look at me and understand who I am and what I believe in and what I would do as president of the United States', 'WALLACE: You had been campaigning the traditional way, spending a lot of time in the states that vote early, such as Iowa', \"Now, given the fact that we're going to base this on national polls, is that going to change your strategy going forward\", 'FIORINA: No, not really', 'You know, I spent, yesterday, in Delaware, helping to raise money for the Delaware GOP', 'I’m today in New Mexico where I was last night with a big fundraiser for the GOP, as well as raising money', 'So, we will continue to work very hard, make sure we have the fuel to run', 'But the early states, of course, are important', \"It's important to build momentum in Iowa\", 'We are', \"It's important to build momentum in South Carolina\", 'We are', 'So, my job is to continue to work very hard, to make sure the American people understand who I am, what I believe in, what I’ll fight for', \"It's why I have been so accessible to the press\", 'I have now answered probably close to 500 on the record questions in three weeks since I launched my campaign', \"WALLACE: Well, let's talk about some of the issues\", 'And I’m going to ask you the 501st question', 'You oppose Common Core education standards', 'And one of your reasons for that has gotten some blow-back', 'Here it is', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)', 'FIORINA: The argument for Common Core is frequently, oh, we have to compete with the Chinese', 'I’ve been doing business in China for decades and I will tell you that, yes, the Chinese can take a test', \"And what they can't do is innovate\", \"They're not terribly imaginative, they’re not entrepreneurial, they don’t innovate\", \"That's why they're stealing our intellectual property\", '(END VIDEO CLIP)', 'WALLACE: But the fact is, China is on track to lead the world in science and technology research by 2019, and more important, the U', 'S', 'now ranks 30th in math literacy in the world and 20th in reading literacy', \"Question, aren't we falling behind not just China but the rest of the world when it comes to education\", 'FIORINA: Well, of course, our education system is a big problem', \"The point I was trying to make about the Chinese is the system they've put in place, standardizes behavior\", \"It's part of the repression of that regime\", \"It's one of the reasons why China, for example, has a strategy of continuing to steal our intellectual property\", \"It's one of the reasons why they have not adhered to the requirements of WTO\", 'Our education system is in trouble, but demonstrably, giving more money to the Department of Education, as we have been doing for almost 40 years, doesn’t improve the sate of education', 'WALLACE: But --', \"FIORINA: Common Core has become, however it was intended originally, Common Core has become a nationally driven set of bureaucratic standards that teach teachers how to teach, that teach children how to learn, and what we need is to provide more parental choice so that our kids anywhere they live have a real chance, and Common Core doesn't help us do that\", 'WALLACE: But I want to pick up on that because you say Common Core is a bureaucratic program coming out of Washington, driven by Washington', 'You talked about the department of education', 'Here are the facts, Ms', \"Fiorina: Common Core standards don't come from the Department of Education\", 'They come from the state governors, and the school officers and local school districts design the curriculum to meet those standards', 'In fact, the federal government is barred by law from setting curriculum -- developing curriculum in local school districts', \"FIORINA: Yes, I understand that's how it started\", 'But the think is, when a Washington bureaucracy gets involved in any program, it becomes heavy-handed and standardized', \"It's how Washington bureaucracies work\", 'And so, the reason you have so many parents and teachers pushing back against Common Core is because they believe, rightly so, that they are losing their choices and their flexibility', \"Here's another fact about Common Core: national textbook companies and national testing companies are helping now to form and drive these standards\", \"It's just how bureaucracies work\", \"We know that the most important thing about a child's education is to have a great teacher in front of the classroom and a lot of choice and accountability with parents, so that parents can school their children however they think their children will be best served, whether that's at home or with vouchers or charters or parochial schools\", \"And Common Core, unfortunately, limits parents' choices\", 'It limits the creativity a teacher can apply in the classroom', \"So, it will over time limit our children's chances\", 'WALLACE: I want to -- you talked earlier about Hillary and Bill Clinton being part of the professional political class', 'I want to take you back to your announcement video', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)', 'FIORINA: Our founders never intended us to is have a professional political class', 'They believe that citizens and leaders need to step forward', 'We know the only way to re-imagine our government is to re-imagine who is leading it', '(END VIDEO CLIP)', 'WALLACE: As I say, you talk a lot about the professional political class, but I was looking at your record in business', 'And you worked for way from decades from being a secretary to sales force to marketing to ending up as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard', 'You paid your dues', \"And I guess the question is, isn't it as questionable to take someone with no political experience and make them president of the United States, as it is to take a politician without business experience and make them the head of a Fortune 100 company like Hewlett-Packard\", 'FIORINA: Well, of course, politics is different than business', 'Of course, business running a company takes a certain set of technical skills', 'Again, ours was intended to be a citizen government', \"But it's not accurate to say that I don't know anything about politics\", 'I have served as an adviser to many politicians', 'I run my own political campaign in California', \"And while I lost that campaign, California's a huge state\", 'So, I gain more Republican votes, more Democratic votes, more independent votes than virtually anyone else running anywhere in the country', \"It's also true I have been in and around government for a long time\", 'Michael Hayden, your next guest, a friend, I chaired the advisory board at the CIA for him for several years', 'I’d advised two secretaries of defense, a secretary of state, a secretary of homeland security', 'I have been all around the world', 'As a business person, I have seen the impact of government on business and on our economy', 'So, I’m not a neophyte, but I’m certainly not a professional politician', \"And when 82 percent of the American people think that the professional class is acting against their interest, I would say that's majority of the Americans\", 'WALLACE: We -- finally, we like to get off the issue at some point and try to get some insight on the person', 'And I’d like to try to do that with you', 'You talk in your book about the fact that in 2009, you lost your daughter Laurie to addiction', 'It was the same time that you were diagnosed with breast cancer', 'And you say reconnecting with your faith is what got you through all of that', 'Can you please share that with us, Ms', 'Fiorina', 'FIORINA: Yes', 'I grew up a faithful person', 'I never lost faith', 'I prayed every day all throughout my life', 'But at some point in life, my faith became fairly abstract', 'And I lost this belief that we have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ', 'And over the course of the several years prior to 2009 through the help of a pastor friend of mine, I re-found that personal relationship', 'And that was incredibly helpful to me, to my husband, to our family', 'One of the reasons I refound that personal connection is through thinking about science', 'You know, human beings have created a GPS system that can keep track of billions of moving objects and provide very precise instructions to all of them', \"And so, it occurred to me that if human beings can do that, certainly God understands what's going on in each of our lives and he answers those prayers that he should\", 'WALLACE: Ms', 'Fiorina, thank you', 'Thank you for sharing that with us', 'Thank you for joining us today', \"And we'll see you on the campaign trail\", 'FIORINA: Thank you, Chris', 'Thank you for having me', 'WALLACE: Up next, our Sunday group joins the

concerns and that will shape what she does on the campaign trail\", 'WALLACE: Brit, without serious competition from -- it seems, in the Democratic primaries, how long can she go without -- I mean, yes, she’s done these rope lines where she takes these questions, answers, and then walks away after quick, short, some would say, not very responsive answers', 'How long can she go without answering questions', 'And is this a smart strategy', 'BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think she can be indefinitely and it may be a smart strategy', 'I learned along time ago covering campaigns, the job of political campaign is not to answer journalists’ questions or to educate the public on the issues, or to reveal everything about your own views on things, when someone in the press or many people in the press want you to', 'The job of a campaign is to get the candidate elected', 'And the Clinton team obviously decided at this stage of the campaign', \"She doesn't need to go out and do that\", \"She's very well known\", \"She doesn't need to answer a lot of reporters' questions\", \"Most candidates are hungry for reporters' questions and attention because that's how they get attention that they need\", \"Without competition and being as well as she is, she doesn't need either of those things\", 'And so, my guess is that she can go indefinitely', 'It may start to hurt her, and when it does, one presumably will find her beginning to do it', \"But so far, it doesn't seem to have hurt her very much\", 'WALLACE: You can argue how much competition that they will provide at the Democratic race, but two Democrats have entered the race against Hillary Clinton this week', \"That's Senator Martin -- rather, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland\", \"And here was O'Malley in his announcement yesterday, his only mention of Hillary Clinton\", '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)', \"MARTIN O’MALLEY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The

has been pushing her to take a position on trade', \"I’m actually interested on what Hillary Clinton does in relation to Sanders and O'Malley\", \"So far, she's generally ignored them\", 'If they get more aggressive in going after her, does she respond', 'I think that puts her in a tricky position', \"WALLACE: There was another troubling story in politics this week, and that was the indictment of former House Speaker Denny Hastert for allegedly paying hush money to a student that he had some involvement with back before his political career in the '70s and '80s, back in Illinois, and he allegedly was paying him hush money not to reveal the fact that Hastert had sexually abused this young man back in those days\", 'George, your thoughts about Hastert', 'Your thoughts about this case',

blackmailing', 'That is he was a high school wrestling coach, and teacher, and then a member of Congress, neither of which are highly remunerative jobs', 'And he became very wealthy', 'First as speaker of the House, he presided over an avalanche of earmarks', 'By 2005, there were 15,000 earmarks attached to various pieces of legislation, one of which created a highway program, highway interchange near some land that he rather anonymously owned that suddenly became very valuable for a development that never developed, but in fact he made a killing from this', 'Second, he then became a lobbyist', 'Big government becomes big by being deeply involved in the allocation of wealth and opportunity', 'Lobbyists are important', \"That's why we spend more time on lobbying than we do on campaigns\", 'They become important precisely because they know how complicated the government is, where the levers and pulleys and widgets are, to make it work', 'And he made the most of that value', \"It's an -- it's an unfortunate glimpse of how hard government is\", 'WALLACE: Hastert lost the speakership during the 2006 election when the Democrats took control', 'One of the big issues at the end of that campaign was that a congressman at the time, Mark Foley, had sent some sexually charged computer messages to a male page -- those are the interns who work in the house, young people

we will go without that access for, what, 72 or 96 hours', \"It probably won't make a difference, but then again, it might\", \"WALLACE: So you're troubled by it\", 'HAYDEN: Yeah', 'WALLACE: On the other hand, does Senator Paul have a point, because three weeks ago a court of appeals ruled that the Patriot Act does not authorize this kind of bulk metadata collection and that the program, the specific program, is illegal', 'HAYDEN: Right', \"So, Senator Paul claimed that it's unconstitutional\", 'Now, the controlling legal authority there is a 1979 court decision that says, indeed, metadata is not, repeat, not constitutionally protected', 'We have no reasonable expectation of privacy there', 'The second argument', 'WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait', 'Quickly explain that', 'What the court ruled was that if I make a call to you, perhaps the conversation between us is protected', 'HAYDEN: Absolutely', 'WALLACE: But the fact that my number calls your number, since this would go on a phone record, which I think in that case was thrown out in the mail and somebody could pick up, the fact that this number called that number for how many minutes, that that is not constitutionally

is fundamentally boring', \"It's not what you see on evening television\", \"It's just piece by piece, thread by thread\", \"You're giving up threads\", 'It may not make a difference for a while',

internal actors than we have been at any time since 9/11\", 'WALLACE: But there seems to be a debate about how effective and how useful these programs are', 'Let me put some things on the screen', \"A recent report by the Justice Department's inspector general said FBI agents could not identify any major case developments that came from bulk data collection\", 'And the Privacy and Civil Liberties oversight board, an independent agency created by Congress, found no instances of abuse of the program, but also no instances where it stopped a terrorist attack', \"Now, you say, well, it's a thread\", \"It's not the silver bullet\", \"But that isn't exactly the good housekeeping seal of approval\", \"HAYDEN: No, and when you had me in here a few months ago, Chris, and we were talking about CIA's renditions, detentions, interrogations, I have the same issue\", 'Show me where it was a silver bullet', \"And I'm saying it doesn't work that way\", \"I mean we seem to get credit only if we get, because of one or another of these programs, we get to tackle with terrorists on the rooftop just as he's about to chamber a round\", 'How about we have a complex intelligence picture created that allows us to take action on the financier, months if not years ahead of that late last-second attempt to kill us', 'WALLACE: OK, so the House has passed the USA Freedom Act, which basically would change the program', 'So instead of the government holding all of these records, the telephone companies who the calls were made on, would hold the records, and then the government would have to go to the phone company with the warrant to get information about a specific series of contacts', 'Could you live with that', 'HAYDEN: Well, clearly, Chris, that is the best political solution out there right now', 'It is not the best operational solution because if it were, this is how we would have organized the thing in the first place', \"So, we're going to take a bit of a leap of faith with the USA Freedom Act, that the telecoms will be able to keep the data, that they will keep it because they're not required by law to keep it, and they'll keep it long enough, and none of them keep it as long as NSA keeps it, and that we'll be able to query the database across multiple entities with an effectiveness and accuracy that matches what it is we can do now against a single database\", \"So, if you're asking me in a perfect world, what would I do, I'd reauthorize the Patriot Act\", 'Can we live with this', 'I understand the politics matter, probably', \"WALLACE: Well, you know, it's interesting because I was talking to some Senate leaders yesterday\", 'And they talked about the possibility', 'We know Mitch McConnell has been against this', \"He wants to just reauthorize the Patriot Act, but bowing, perhaps, to political reality, he's considering, yes, this, the Freedom Act, but with amendments\", \"And some of the amendments that are being talked about, one would be that the president would have to certify that it will work, that, in fact, it isn't just a theoretical issue, but if the NSA or the CIA wants to query AT&T, that they'll be able to get the information\", 'And then the other is, as you point out, the U', 'S', \"Freedom Act doesn't require a company to actually hold onto these records\", 'And the concern is that a phone company might market it and say, hey, guess what, you sign up with us, we are not going to keep your records', 'HAYDEN: Yeah, family, friends and nobody else', 'WALLACE: So, I mean, do you think that those -- how important do you think those kinds of amendments are', 'HAYDEN: I think they would be very useful', \"As I said before, the way it's currently constructed is a leap of faith, an act of faith, that the companies will do this, and technologically we will be able to do it as well as we do it now\", \"I would like to have the administration Mike Rogers, the current director of NSA, come in in a fix period of time and candidly tell the Congress, here is how it worked as well, here is how it's not working as well\", \"It's what we used to do\", 'And then, Chris, I get it', 'We get to draw this line all the time between liberty and security', \"But let's do it based on the facts\", 'How much security are we giving up for how much more liberty', \"In a program in which you've already mentioned, there have been no abuses\", 'WALLACE: OK, finally', \"And I've got a little over a minute left\", 'I want to move briefly to ISIS, which is on the march, as you well know, both in Iraq and in Syria', 'You said recently that you think that the U', 'S', 'military is under-resourced and overregulated', 'Explain', 'HAYDEN: Sure', 'We have got about 3,000 people there', 'I think most people think the right number to do what it is the president has laid out, degrade and defeat ISIS, is probably 5,000 to 10,000', 'But more important than the numbers are the rules of engagement', \"We don't go forward\", \"We don't embed with the Iraqi military\", \"We go below the brigade level, which is a very high echelon, we don't have tactical air control party's forward, and we've not made very frequent use of our Special Operations forces at all\", \"WALLACE: So, you'd put them more in the fight\", \"HAYDEN: Unfortunately, that's more at risk\", 'I get that', 'But I would put them more in the fight', 'Chris, the president has declared that defeating ISIS is a strategic interest of the United States', \"WALLACE: And based on what you've seen from this president so far, what do you think is the likely about that he'll, one, increase the number of U\", 'S', 'troops in Iraq and, two, put them in a more dangerous, vulnerable, but also more effective fighting position', 'HAYDEN: I think the

for this competition, the device will be a tool capable of capturing key health metrics and diagnosing a set of 12 diseases', 'Metrics for health could include such elements as blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature', 'Ultimately, this tool will collect large volumes of data from ongoing measurement of health states through a combination of wireless sensors, imaging technologies, and portable, non-invasive laboratory replacements', 'The devices are expected to accurately diagnose 13 health conditions (12 diseases and the absence of conditions) – 10 required core conditions and a choice of three elective conditions – in addition to capturing five real-time health vital signs, independent of a health care worker or facility, and in a way that provides a compelling consumer experience', 'Required Core Health Conditions (10): Anemia, Atrial Fibrillation (AFib), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Diabetes, Leukocytosis, Pneumonia, Otitis Media, Sleep Apnea, Urinary Tract Infection, Absence of condition', 'Elective Health Conditions (Choice of 3): Cholesterol Screen, Food-borne Illness, HIV Screen, Hypertension, Hypothyroidism/Hyperthyroidism, Melanoma, Mononucleosis, Pertussis (Whooping Cough), Shingles, Strep Throat', 'Required Health Vital Signs (5): Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Oxygen Saturation, Respiratory Rate, Temperature', \"Given that each team will take its own approach to design and functionality, the device's physical appearance and functionality may vary immensely from team to team\", 'Indeed, the only stated limit on form is that the mass of its components together must be no greater than five (5) pounds', 'But because an important part of the qualifying round will be evaluating consumer experience in using it, the limitations set by this competition will force teams to make choices', 'Teams will have to consider tradeoffs amongst weight, functionality, power requirements, battery life, screen resolution, AI engine location, diagnosis capability, end consumer cost, and so on', 'Beyond the weight requirement, there is no limit as to how many discrete components constitute a viable solution', 'For example, teams may use sensors that are attached to a phone-like control unit, fastened individually to the consumer, or kept apart and reserved for occasional use or home monitoring', 'Similarly, teams may create a tool that has a large screen, a small screen, or perhaps even no screen (audio only)', 'Systems must include a way for consumers to store and share their information, which must be accessible remotely via the Internet', 'Additionally, teams are expected to follow guidelines and protocols that help ensure that consumer safety is held in the highest regard', 'This includes avoiding harm from electrical energy, thermal energy, chemical exposures, needles, lancets, and infection', 'As part of the Final Round, teams will compete in both diagnostic experience evaluations and consumer testing, slated for late 2016', 'The final judging and awards ceremony is scheduled to take place in 2017', 'Throughout the competition, the U', 'S', 'Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is offering regulatory input to the competing teams and helping them prepare for potential FDA review post-competition', 'The Need for the Prize', 'In virtually every industry, end consumer needs drive advances and improvements', 'Except in healthcare', 'Very few methods exist for consumers to receive direct medical care without seeing a healthcare professional at a clinic or hospital, creating an access bottleneck', 'Despite substantial investment to improve the status quo, even average levels of service, efficiency, affordability, accessibility, and satisfaction remain out of reach for many whom the system was intended to help', 'A prize is thus sorely needed', 'In response to this widespread need, the Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE will:', 'Address the dual challenge of a) transforming healthcare by turning the \"art\" of medicine into a science, and b) making health an integrated part of individuals\\' daily lives', 'Tackle needed breakthroughs in sensing technologies, technological integration, regulatory acceptance, and the perception that healthcare should be controlled by only a few skilled parties', 'Incentivize teams to focus on a) precision diagnosis and measurement that is independent of healthcare institutions/professionals and on b) consumer needs/adoption', 'Facilitate necessary partnerships and regulatory pathways required for this major transformation', \"Inspire a future where consumers demand the tools to assess and manage their health independent of a hospital or doctor's office\", 'Spark the creation of markets and products that offer medical detection, prevention, and management, as well as more complete diagnostics', 'Genesis of the Competition', 'Each year, the XPRIZE Foundation gathers thought leaders from around the world, for a 3-day summit called Visioneering, to debate and brainstorm solutions to the world’s “Grand Challenges” through incentivized prize competitions', 'During one session in 2010, The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Physician and Lab-on-a-Chip prizes were conceived', 'Immediately, it became clear these two concepts complemented each other and should be combined into one prize with a new and unique focus on consumer needs rather than a device for clinicians and doctors', 'It was envisioned that this hand-held consumer device would allow individuals to access the state of their own health anytime, anywhere, and potentially revolutionize how people could interact with the healthcare system', 'Contributing to both prize development and the architecture of prize design was Dr', 'Daniel Kraft, a Stanford and Harvard-trained physician-scientist with over 20 years of experience in clinical practice, biomedical research and innovation', 'In early December 2010, Dr', 'Peter H', 'Diamandis, the Founder and Executive Chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, met with Don Jones, Vice President of Global Strategy and Market Development for Qualcomm Incorporated’s Wireless Health group, now Qualcomm Life, Inc', 'During these conversations, the scope of the prize began to rapidly take form', 'Mr', 'Jones saw how the prize conceptually would lead to development of a device akin to the famous Star Trek “Tricorder,” and initiated a meeting with Dr', 'Paul E', 'Jacobs, Qualcomm Chairman and CEO and Qualcomm Foundation Chair', 'Dr', 'Jacobs immediately saw the potential value of the competition', 'Following initial prize development underwritten by Qualcomm, the Qualcomm Foundation agreed to sponsor the competition, enabling the Tricorder XPRIZE to become a reality, culminating in the launch of the Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE competition at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2012', 'The announcement of the prize was made during Dr', 'Paul Jacobs’ keynote address', 'Dr', 'Diamandis joined Dr', 'Jacobs on stage to introduce the competition', 'By launching this incentivized competition, the XPRIZE Foundation and the Qualcomm Foundation seek to make 23rd century science fiction a 21st century medical reality that will empower consumers to take control of their own healthcare, improving the quality of life for people everywhere']\n",

involved in that policy and say, how did you do it', 'What were the keys to keeping the country safe over that period of time', \"Instead, they're out there now threatening to disbar the lawyers who gave us the legal opinions, threatening, contrary to what the president originally said, they were going to go out and investigate the CIA personnel who carried out those investigations\", '(END VIDEO

information with Congress, respect for the law, and I'm not surprised that he is upset about this\", \"The Obama administration has no intention -- I think the president himself has been unbelievably bending in the direction of trying to be careful about what happens to national security, protecting our national security interests, being very sensitive about the CIA's prerogatives and needs and so forth\", 'And in fact, I think there is a little bit of a tension between the White House itself and the lawyers in the Justice Department as they see the law and as what their obligation is', \"And in a sense, that's good\", \"That's appropriate, because it shows that we have an attorney general who is not pursuing a political agenda, but who is doing what he believes the law requires him to do\", 'And we have an administration, on the other hand, that is balancing some of those other interests', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: The vice president also said that he believes that CIA officials who went outside the bounds of the guidelines they were given were justified', 'Do you agree with that', 'HATCH: There is a real question whether they went outside of the bounds that they were given at the time', \"Look, I -- as the longest- serving person in the Senate Intelligence Committee, I've got to tell you, we don't want to cripple our ability to be able, in very crucial times, to get the information we've got to have to save our country and to protect our people\", 'I think what Dick Cheney is arguing for -- and look, how can anybody argue that Cheney has been a great asset to the country in so many ways', 'He is a tough guy, there is no question', 'He differs from the so-called progressives in the Congress', 'And I really question, after all of the investigations were done, some prosecutions that were waged, and most of this material was decided not to go forward, to now go forward with this, I really question whether the attorney general is doing what is right', 'And

legacy', 'It is the things he did outside of the Senate that people remember', \"But it was liberating to lose that nomination fight to Jimmy Carter, get that monkey off his back, and the next few years, particularly when he married Vicki, I think the whole body of Ted Kennedy's work has to be judged\", 'And in judging the whole body, I think I agree with George', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: E', 'J', \", Ted Kennedy himself put it in context, in this remarkable scene -- I don't know how many saw it -- but last night at Arlington Cemetery, Cardinal McCarrick read the letter, parts of the letter that Ted Kennedy wrote to the pope earlier this summer, and he talked about how he wasn't a perfect person, but he also seemed to use his Catholic faith and say that his public career had -- was rooted in his faith and an expression of his faith\", \"DIONNE: You know, we Catholics believe profoundly in the power of confession, and in a way, part of that letter was Ted Kennedy's last confession, an acknowledgement of sin\", 'What he really did is he got the last word at his own funeral, and it was an extraordinary manifesto in part', 'And I think he was -- his Catholicism was very important to him', 'He was a serious churchgoer, and it was not only a way to make a public case for his kind of liberal Catholicism, it was also a way of lobbying Pope Benedict', \"And it's fascinating that

'He was the Democrat who in the country Republicans loved to hate, but you saw so much here inside the Capitol so many Republicans loved him', 'CHENEY: Well, I think that goes to sort of what he was like as a man off the floor of the Senate', 'I think obviously, there were some very bitter partisan debates that people had with him, but I too was struck by the eulogies you heard by people like Senator Hatch and others, Senator McCain, as well', 'And I think also, you know, what he showed was sort of the example of a man who dedicated his professional life to service the nation', \"And, you know, I think at a time that we're in now for the country, it is an example and I think it's an example for young people\", 'I hope it serves as an example for young people, sort of the nobility of

know, speaking of the young people, you were at the funeral yesterday', \"You also covered Senator Kennedy in the Senate, and it was another striking moment, not only the sons but also the nieces, the nephews, the grandchildren using the litany to talk about Ted Kennedy's public works\", 'IFILL: You know, I served on the board -- I serve on the board of the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School, and Senator Kennedy was on that board obviously as is his niece', 'And he not only reached out to the children of his family, he also spent a lot of time every time he visited Harvard with the students who wanted to be future public servants', 'Not just people who wanted to be politicians, people who volunteered in local schools in Cambridge and people who do amazing things and that would come to Washington and intern in various offices, Republicans, Democrats, you name it', 'And he was very invested in that in the name of his brother and in the name of his family', 'But it was also an example of how Ted Kennedy, and I noticed this yesterday in all of the eulogies and all weekend long, he was known as the great lion, the great liberal lion', 'And he was that', 'But he was liberal in a way that Jack Kemp used to say he was a Democrat and that was a little \"L\" and Jack Kemp was a little \"D', '\"', 'In that he believed in expansiveness', 'When he defined civil rights, he thought civil rights applied to people who were disabled and to people who wanted to be married who are same sex and he thought that liberalism applied to people who needed to vote at the age of 18 and young girls who wanted to compete in athletics', 'He had a hand in all of these things, so very expansive', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Expansive, George, but you point out that era may be over and I want to pick up on the conversations that Senators Kerry and Hatch had', 'Is there any way that anyone, any senator can fill that void, that niche', \"WILL: I don't think so, partly because this was a product of longevity and the enormous niceness of the man\", 'People just liked Ted Kennedy', \"The funny thing is what's happened in this August it seems to me is the country has indicated a bifurcated mind, great affection for Ted Kennedy\", 'But at the same time, they are having second thoughts about this president and this president is the first Ted Kennedy Democrat elected since Roosevelt',

regretted not winning the White House himself', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)', 'KENNEDY: My pursuit is public service, not the constant pursuit of the presidency', 'I said that almost 25 years ago, so I have

time', 'WILL: Conservatives spend our lives saying there is a reason things are as they are', \"There are vast forces out there and there's a reason why health care is very difficult to do\", 'WILL:

cast by voters 50 years old or older', 'By 2030, when the baby boomers have all retired, there will be more Americans 65 years old or older than there are Americans 18 or under', 'This is the politics of gerontocracy', \"And what we're learning is that those to whom health care is most important are most wary of this program\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: You know what's interesting, Gwen, is that Senator

Well, first of all, I'm so glad George mentioned Medicare because it is an extraordinary conservative hypocrisy you're seeing now that Republicans are emerging as the great defenders of Medicare, a program they once tried to cut\", 'They say they hate socialized medicine', 'Medicare is socialized medicine', \"So it's a really remarkable point we've gotten to here\", \"The fact is that the Democrats, I think, know what a huge price they paid as a party when Bill Clinton's health care bill went down in 1994\", \"And I think, from left to right in that party, or left to center, they know

well', '(LAUGHTER)', \"Are the Democrats who are for the public option now -- do you think they've absorbed the lesson you say you've absorbed, which is the consequence of failure is just too -- too

now, it's only an ideological debate\", \"We're not talking about the actual benefits it could produce in terms of cost -- saving money\", \"In the end, if he fights for it and it's clear that you can't get a bill without it, then I think liberals would go along, if you could massively increase coverage\", \"You've got to push it\", \"CHENEY: I think that, you know, there's a much bigger problem here\", \"I think you've got a situation where President Obama, who is supposed to be, sort of, the great communicator, the White House rolls him out for three town hall meetings over the course of the last several months, and on issue after issue where he's attempting to provide some comfort to the American people, you know, they're looking at focus groups and they're seeing that the American people want costs down\", 'So the president asserts that this -- these plans, which everyone has adopted, will in fact result in a cost cut', \"And then the CBO and now the OMB, also, in Peter Orszag's letter, have said that's not the case; in fact, we're going to increase the deficit\", 'On an issue like, will you be able to keep your own health insurance if you like it, the president is out there asserting, in these town halls, yes, you can keep your own health insurance', \"But then, in a conference call with liberal bloggers, when he's asked about a particular provision in the legislation that sounds like it wouldn't allow to you keep your own insurance, he has to admit he hasn't read the bill\", \"So there's a deeper problem here\", 'The American people are very', '(CROSSTALK)', 'CHENEY: Well, this was H', 'R', '3200 they were talking about', '(CROSSTALK)', \"CHENEY: But there's a deeper problem here, which is that the American people fundamentally are scared about, you know, whatever bill is being proposed, and they, sort of, look to their president, particularly one who has been such an effective communicator in the past, to be able to give them some comfort\", \"And when they see such a difference between the president's rhetoric and blanket assertions and the specifics in any of the pieces of legislation\", \"DONALDSON: You're right,

holiday, is what is the line that he can force', '(CROSSTALK)', \"CHENEY: It's more than a technical problem, though\", 'You know, the White House is now facing a really tough choice, which is, are you going to not get anything on what the president has said is his central domestic policy issue, or are you going to push it through with the Democrats', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, and that's a -- that's a -- there's a tactical problem there\", 'Go ahead', \"DIONNE: Well, I was going to say, people are torn because they're always afraid that if government does the wrong thing, they're going to

right now', 'WILL: First, on a point of order', '(LAUGHTER)', 'Brother E', 'J', 'says the Republicans are guilty of hypocrisy for now defending Medicare against cuts', 'The president is guilty of

general is not going to investigate those who wrote the law', \"He's not going to investigate the policymakers, only those who went outside the guidelines given to the CIA\", \"WILL: The president speaks as though he's a disinterested bystander, and the Obama administration's position seems to be, the president cannot control the attorney general -- which is false -- and even more dangerously false, that the attorney general can control this prosecutor\", \"If we've learned anything at all -- and we maybe haven't -- from all the prosecutors we've had in recent years, it is that they get their own momentum, they get their own agenda, they follow what they call the logic of the law, and\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: So what's the danger then\", 'WILL: The danger is that you not only start to prosecute people in a way that looks like double jeopardy in some cases, but you begin to go up the food chain toward the senior levels of the Bush administration', 'DONALDSON: George, as I understand it, a person that has been called a prosecutor has been appointed to determine whether in his opinion there is grounds to proceed with prosecutions', 'He will make a recommendation', 'There are no prosecutions', 'He is not prosecuting at the moment', 'WILL: And if he recommends yes, who is to say no', '(CROSSTALK)', 'DONALDSON: Well, as you say, it will be the president ultimately',

investigation, and that further on in the process, either the attorney general or the White House could then make the decision -- you know you're right, these were investigated before, it's not worth prosecuting again, even though there is some evidence\", \"CHENEY: Well, I'm not sure that there is some evidence\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: If there were', 'CHENEY: This was looked at for five years by career prosecutors', 'They decided not to prosecute, except in one case where a contractor has been convicted and is in jail', 'In the other cases, Leon Panetta himself has laid out to his employees

political investigation at a moment when we need the CIA focused on keeping the nation safe', \"And there's no question but that when you start talking about investigating and prosecuting, people having to hire lawyers to defend against this, it is simply the case that their attention is not entirely focused where we need it to be\", \"And I think it's very damaging (ph)\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: E', 'J', ', there does seem to be a dilemma here', \"On the one hand, the Justice Department lawyers say, listen, if there's some evidence of wrongdoing, we're bound by statutes to investigate\", 'On the other hand, you do have this double jeopardy problem, where people were investigated under the previous administration', 'Even if you find some (inaudible) evidence, there might be a reason not to go forward because it does appear to be politicizing this', \"DIONNE: You know, what's astonishing is that Eric Holder is being accused of politicizing this when he has made a decision that has

'CHENEY: It is -- nobody raped anybody and nobody', '(CROSSTALK)', 'DONALDSON: No, (inaudible) they threatened it', 'CHENEY: There is a big difference', 'But let me -- the other point here to look at', \"DONALDSON: Oh, if I threaten you but don't actually hit you, there's a big difference, but you can call me to court\", '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: The law said that the threats were illegal', \"I mean, it's against the law\", 'CHENEY: No, wait a second', \"That's not clear\", \"And the standard -- we don't want to spend a whole panel here on the standard for the legal investigation\", 'DONALDSON: Why not', '(CROSSTALK)', \"CHENEY: You guys have misstated the standard for the legal investigation here, and I would point you to Andy McCarthy's excellent piece in National Review Online, which goes through what the standard is that the Justice Department should have applied here, which is the notion that you need evidence, that you can move beyond the presumption of innocence in a court of law, that torture occurred and that is not here, and that was, as I said, it was looked at before\", 'But the other point that is critical to me', 'DONALDSON: Everyone except one person that I know of (inaudible) says torture and waterboarding is wrong', \"CHENEY: The lack of -- waterboarding isn't torture\", 'And we can go down that path', 'But the lack of seriousness here is important', '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: I got to go to another question here', 'CHENEY: It also goes to the point about moving the interrogations out of the CIA into the White House', \"And I think that the fact that the White House can't even tell us who is in charge of these interrogations now combined\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, they say that there has to be broader sharing, that's what everybody wants, the FBI, the CIA\", '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: But I do want to get to the other question of the information we gleaned from all this, and whether it was --

commission', \"Fred Hyatt in the Washington Post suggests this morning, Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter, bring them down, set it up, and answer some factual questions\", 'For example, Khalid

or how immoral they are surely depends on whether or not they work', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And how useful the information was, whether it could have been gotten in other ways, these are big questions', '(CROSSTALK)', \"DIONNE: Right, and because the CIA's own office of legal counsel raised questions in its report about how effective these methods are, and the worst thing would be to do something wrong and have it been ineffective\", 'DONALDSON: And (inaudible) say it saves lives, and that may be', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: If it saved lives', 'CHENEY: If', 'Hold on', 'If you read the documents that were released', '(CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: Sam, Liz, go ahead', 'DONALDSON: All right', \"I'm with Admiral Blair, who is our top intelligence guy\", 'Supposedly everyone comes under him', 'He said he thought we did receive some useful information from these techniques', \"He then said, the part that's left out by people who take the first part, but in our relationship with the rest of the world and the way the United States is viewed by the rest of the world, it was not worth it\", 'We have lost more by those techniques than we gained', 'I am with Admiral Blair', 'CHENEY: Well, I would suggest you read the documents in their entirety', 'DONALDSON: I read what he said', \"CHENEY: In their entirety, the documents that were released, because in those documents it makes absolutely clear not only in the inspector general's report, page 91, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed provided information that was inaccurate and incomplete prior to being waterboarded, but also if you read the addendum to that document, which is an interview that was done with a senior CIA official, makes clear that that information could not have been gained through other ways, says that the techniques were invaluable and that they worked\", 'The documents -- let me finish', 'DIONNE: It does not prove that waterboarding produced that', \"It just doesn't\", 'CHENEY: Guys, guys, the documents demonstrate conclusively that the enhanced interrogation program provided information that saved lives', 'Four former CIA directors including', 'DONALDSON: Why did the Bush administration renounce waterboarding in its last two years', '(CROSSTALK)', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going to have to continue this\", 'CHENEY: Dennis Blair said it worked', 'And the White House edited that part out of his statement', '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: We are out of time', 'I just say this one other -- the inspector general said -- the inspector general in the report, the inspector general said that finally it is a

keeping jobs here through the Green New Deal', 'One of the', 'things that that bill`s about, which we`ll talk about later I think, is', 'about energy efficiency', 'So when you have a manufacturer

'People who work in your', 'industry have been investing and building cars for decades, for', 'generations', 'So why not unleash the innovation, the entrepreneurialism of', 'your industry to actually

for', 'everyone', 'And so, I - the reason why I believe the Green New Deal is such a market', 'opportunity is because it`s a strategy to keep jobs here, to create', 'innovation, and I also believe we should put a price on carbon', 'And the', 'reason why this is so relevant to you – so when you have manufacturers', 'that send jobs overseas, they`re producing typical, traditional cars that', 'are polluting the environment', 'Why not reward the innovators in the United', 'States with much lower taxes and tax requirements to incentivize capital', 'flows to keep those jobs here', 'FREER: Can I follow up on that', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, please', 'FREER: I think you make outstanding points, and I love your vision', 'The', 'thing I`m interested also to know is, you talked about making it',

benefits to make it cheaper to put a', 'manufacturing plant in Michigan today to manufacturing cars', 'That – money', 'flows when tax rates are lower', 'That`s just how the economy works', 'The', 'other thing I would do is take on China in a very different way than Trump', 'does', 'So Trump has started a trade war', 'When you start a trade war,', 'you`re not holding China accountable', 'In fact, you`re just raising prices', 'Steel, a fundamental input for manufacturing, because we have a trade war', 'with China on steel, it`s raising the cost of you producing that steel in', 'American

markets and -', 'HAYES: Right', 'GILLIBRAND: - and totally undermine our manufacturing and our', 'competitiveness, and we didn`t hold them accountable enough', 'So there`s a', 'difference between

thing about that name', 'PLESSNER: Oh my gosh (ph), I love that', 'Well very cool', 'GILLIBRAND: So tell me more about Theo (ph)', 'PLESSNER: Yes absolutely', 'So I just realized when I was off like how', 'difficult it is to be a new mom, how crazy I felt all the time', 'And like I', 'said, I had the time off, but I just don`t understand how women do it', 'without that flexibility', 'So I know you talk about -', 'GILLIBRAND: How did you have the time off', 'PLESSNER: Yes, so my company provides four months of paid family leave', 'GILLIBRAND: Paid leave', 'Oh my goodness, so you`re one of the lucky ones', 'Yes, she is a lucky one', 'HAYES: Can I just say there is just a - there was a room wide gasp over -', 'over what is the bare minimum of OECD paid family leave in the rest of the', 'industrialized world', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, you realize - you realize less than 16 percent of', 'American workers have access to paid leave', 'And we are the only', 'industrialized country in the world that doesn`t actually have paid leave', 'as a national priority', 'So what`s your question', 'PLESSNER: So my question is how are you planning to enact that, like what', 'are your visions for that, what are -', 'GILLIBRAND: Well the vision -', 'PLESSNER: – how are you going to get people to sign onto that', 'It seems', 'like a very obvious thing to me', 'HAYES: That`s a good question', 'GILLIBRAND: OK, I`ll tell you how', 'So first of all, the American people', 'want national paid leave', 'Let`s start there', 'We even have a president who', 'I agree with on basically nothing talking about the need for paid leave', 'HAYES: It`s true', 'GILLIBRAND: We have Republican candidates talk about paid leave and many', 'Democratic candidates', 'So the country is in agreement, we need national paid leave', 'The best way', 'to provide national paid leave is to make it an earned benefit, so that you', 'buy in over your lifetime whether you`re working full time, part time, big', 'business, small business, so that it`s yours', 'It`s the way for a small state, like when I was talking about this idea', 'years ago, a place like North Dakota, they vetoed paid leave because the', 'state wasn`t big enough to pass it on their own', 'New York and California', 'have already passed paid leave', 'But not smaller states, because they don`t', 'have enough people', 'And so if you bought in', '2 percent of your income,', 'it`s basically two dollars a week, would you pay two dollars a week to get', 'access to paid leave', 'PLESSNER: Sure', 'GILLIBRAND: Of course you would', 'PLESSNER: Of course I would', '(CROSSTALK)', 'HAYES: So this works like social insurance, like -', 'GILLIBRAND: It`s like social security, it`s the cost of a cup of coffee a', 'week, and if I go to every employer in America and say would you buy every', 'employee of yours one cup of coffee a week so that he or she can have paid', 'leave when their family member needed it, overwhelmingly small businesses', 'that can`t offer it, they don`t have the ability, don`t have the resources', 'to offer it will say “Yes I can offer that', '”', 'And there`s no overhead because it`s just like social security', 'PLESSNER: So, sorry can I - can I clear up something', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, yes', 'PLESSNER: OK, so both me and my employer would be paying into this fund', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, two dollars a week', 'So it`s not a lot of money -', 'HAYES: So like unemployment, insurance, disability, social security', 'GILLIBRAND: It`s $104 a year for employees, you pay, they pay, that`s not', 'a great deal of money and one that if you create this fund, Chris, when', 'your employer says “Oh gosh, she`s going to be out for three months, I`m', 'going to have to hire a quick replacement worker or a temp,” they can use', 'your old salary to begin to fund that temp, because now you`re going to get', 'the payment straight out of your fund that you bought in', 'So it`s yours', 'You get to take it with you everywhere you go', 'HAYES: Sonia, you`ve got a - you`ve got a daughter who`s in college now,', 'is that right', 'SONIA PATEL, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: No, she`s in high school, I have a son in', 'college', 'HAYES: Son in college, and you`re sort of thinking about what their career', 'or job opportunity is going to look like, what would you like to hear', 'PATEL: Right, well I had so many fears for them that I didn`t have before,', 'I mean there`s -they`re children of immigrants, now I worry about my', 'daughter, I worry about, you know, if she`s ever assaulted no one`s going', 'to believe her', 'I worry about the opportunities presented for her, I worry that she`s going', 'to out work anyone, but I don`t know if she`s going to be paid for that', 'work', 'I just - I feel as a mom in this day and age, everything is', 'different', 'GILLIBRAND: So many issues', 'OK, so we`ll talk about education first, and', 'one of the problems with President Trump is Betsy DeVos', 'I voted against Betsy DeVos, I voted against most of President Trump`s', 'nominees for his cabinet because they were either unqualified or they did', 'not have the experience necessary', 'I have the best voting record against', 'Trump nominees of anyone else running for president', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: And the reason why I`m so disturbed about Betsy Devos`s exact', 'words, she said she doesn`t actually want to enforce Title IX requirements,', 'she doesn`t want to protect survivors of sexual violence on a college', 'campus', 'I`ve been working on a bipartisan basis – and remember,', 'bipartisan basis about how you get things done with – with an array of', 'senators from all different backgrounds including Marco Rubio on this issue', '–', 'PATEL: Wow', 'GILLIBRAND: – on this issue of how do we end – how do we end sexual', 'violence and assault on a college campus', 'We need transparency and', 'accountability, we have to have a nationwide survey so every kid in America', 'can fill out a form saying do you feel safe, have you been assaulted, if', 'you have did you report, if not, why not', 'That would create transparency', 'and accountability overnight', 'We need memorandums of understanding to work with law enforcement so if', 'someone is a survivor and wants to go to law enforcement, they won`t` be', 'laughed out of the police station, which happens all the time', 'And you', 'need to make sure that you hold them accountable, and to make sure anyone', 'who deals in these cases is fully trained, so that`s issue one', 'You also were worried about affordability', 'Student debt is one of the', 'biggest crises we have in this country today', 'I believe that the federal', 'should not be making money off the backs of our students and that`s exactly', 'what`s happening –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: So one of the quickest ways to get rid of student debt is', 'refinance all federal student debt at the lowest rate for debt that`s', 'available', 'So your house mortgage, your business loan –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: – today that`s about four percent', 'If you refinance all', 'federal debt at four percent automatically you would be $15 billion right', 'back into the economy', 'HAYES: Wow', 'GILLIBRAND: I also think that we should –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: – make college more affordable to more kids', 'Imagine telling', 'every American kid if you do public service for a year, you get two years', 'free of community college (inaudible) –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: Imagine if you told them – imagine if you told them if you –', 'if you do two years of public service, you get four years free', 'PATEL: Wow', 'GILLIBRAND: That would create a pipeline of kids doing service for someone', 'else', 'And I promise you, when you spend any time putting others before', 'yourself – any time, whether you`re in healthcare or education or as a', 'first responder or as someone in the military – it`s an expansion of the', 'G', 'I', 'bill', 'And it works', 'The G', 'I', 'bill is one of the greatest economic', 'engines in our history', 'So that`s my big idea for how more kids can get to', 'education that`s much more affordable, because it`s free (ph)', 'PATEL: I like it', '(APPLAUSE)', 'HAYES: We`ve got some more questions from folks here', 'I want to thank', 'Eddie and Rebecca, A', 'J', 'and Sonia', 'Thank you so much', 'We`ll be back with', 'some more

RESIDENT: You like lollipops', 'UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes', 'BROOKS: When I was out knocking door-to-door for various candidates, I was', 'talking to a lot of people in the area', 'A lot of people are also', 'interested in healthcare and were concerned about healthcare', 'My name is Teresa Brooks (ph)', 'I am a wife, a mother, and a physician', 'I', 'never considered myself to be a political person, and that really changed', 'in 2007, 2008 with the candidacy of Barack Obama, and I was very inspired', 'by him', 'But then I stopped paying attention and I got complacent', 'UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When it comes to healthcare, what are you hearing from', 'voters', 'BROOKS: Obviously I`m a physician, so I`m in the industry', 'And so, it is', 'something that I see everyday, day-in and day-out', 'And there`s a lot of', 'concerns that people have especially with their insurance - their health', 'insurance', 'People really want a healthcare system that can work for them', 'I think it`s important for everyone to have access to affordable', 'healthcare', '(END VIDEO TAPE)', 'HAYES: That was Michigan physician Teresa Brooks who is here to ask a', 'question from Senator Kirsten Gillibrand', 'She`s joined by some other', 'Michiganders', 'We have joining her Rick Joseph who is 2016 Michigan Teacher', 'of the Year', 'He`s from the Birmingham Public Schools', '(APPLAUSE)', 'HAYES: We have David Sanchez who`s an immigrant rights organizer with', 'Michigan United', 'And Nayyirah Shariff who`s the director of Flint Rising', 'Teresa, you have a question on healthcare for the Senator', 'BROOKS: Yes, so I am a physician, and as a physician and a healthcare', 'provider, we are on the frontlines', 'So I`ve seen many concerning things on', 'healthcare recently especially', 'I have a patient who he works, he has a', 'job, but he cannot afford the premiums that are rising, he cannot afford', 'the $900 a month premiums', 'He also makes too much money to qualify for the', 'ACA and Medicaid, and he`s too young to qualify for Medicare', 'So he is', 'literally praying every day that he doesn`t develop some catastrophic', 'illness until he`s able to qualify for Medicare', 'I have a patient just', 'last week who told me he couldn`t afford his insulin, and he was asking me', 'what could he do', 'And insulin, you can`t live without insulin if you`re an insulin-dependent', 'diabetic', 'It`s a life saving medication', 'And I have a lot of patients', 'that are of mature population and they live on a fixed income and they', 'cannot afford these rising premiums and co-pays and healthcare costs that', 'are happening', 'So, you know, I know that you support Medicare for All', 'How would that work', 'How you would implement it, how would you get it', 'done', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'So I believe, as I think most Americans do, that', 'healthcare should be a right and not a privilege', 'And that means you have', 'to fight for universal coverage that`s affordable and quality for', 'everybody', 'I think the quickest way you get there is you allow anyone to', 'buy into Medicare at a price they can afford – something like four or five', 'percent of income', 'They buy in, so it`s an earned benefit and they are', 'qualified automatically for Medicare', 'What that does at a minimum is', 'create competition in the system immediately', 'Those insurers, I don`t', 'think they are going to compete', 'They refuse to lower their rates; they`re', 'pricing people out of the market today', 'But for the Affordable Care Act they were dropping people with preexisting', 'conditions and under President Trump they`re going to keep dropping people', 'with preexisting conditions', 'So the truth is, let`s have a not-for-profit', 'public option compete for the business', 'I think over a couple years we`re', 'going to transition into single payer', 'HAYES: So I just want to be clear on that', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'HAYES: So you`re not saying start with single payer', 'What you`re saying', 'is introduce potentially a buy-in option –', 'GILLIBRAND: Correct', 'HAYES: – and it`s possible that private insurance continues to exist', 'under that –', '(CROSSTALK)', 'GILLIBRAND: I dare them', 'HAYES: That`s OK with you (ph)', 'GILLIBRAND: I dare them, because I don`t think they will meet the needs', 'because they`re a for-profit company', 'When your goal is to make money for', 'your shareholders, you are not giving that patient the medicine they need', 'or the treatment they need or the extra day in the hospital they need', 'because it doesn`t allow you to make enough money', 'So I don`t think they will compete', 'So create this not-for-profit public', 'option as they transition', 'I imagine within a few years most of Americans', 'are going to choose Medicare, because it`s quality, it`s more affordable I', 'mean in your own mind, just think four or five percent of income on what', 'you make today', 'Is that cheaper or not', 'It`s going to be cheaper', 'If you', 'make $100,000, it`s $4,000 a year', 'It is cheaper', 'And almost – most Americans earn less than that, so that would be what I', 'would do because Medicare works', 'HAYES: Rick, you had a question for the senator', 'RICK JOSEPH, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: I started my career in Chicago as a', 'bilingual (inaudible) teacher, Spanish is my second language and as a', 'National Board certified teacher I`m aware of the role that teachers play', 'as leaders', 'I also was recently in El Paso, Texas, and I`m happy to report', 'the only crisis on our border has been manufactured by this administration', 'GILLIBRAND: True facts', '(APPLAUSE)', 'JOSEPH: And I would was there through an organization called Teachers', 'Against Child Detention and my colleagues Amy (ph) (inaudible) teaches', 'refugees and immigrants in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and one of her student', 'wrote this poem, I want to read it to you', 'She`s from El Salvador', 'She says, there was nowhere else to but here', 'No', 'schools to danger', 'No friends to danger', 'No life to danger', '(Inaudible)', '– the painted ones, in the (inaudible) too much danger', 'They rape, they', 'rape, they rape, they kill', 'Girls have no chance', 'There was nowhere else', 'to go but here', 'So the refugees that come to our Southern border, they come because of', 'these dire situations, so I`m wondering what you will do as president to', 'address these issues related to immigration and how we can uphold our', 'immigration policies so that we enshrine asylum seekers and refugees and', 'give them the opportunity to practice their rights and seek asylum', 'And', 'then in – on a greater level how can we address equity issues at the', 'federal level for education policy so we make sure that we are supporting', 'equitable funding initiatives across our country', 'GILLIBRAND: So, immigration first to me (ph), education second', 'I', 'believe that immigration has always been a strength of this country', 'Our', 'country was largely founded by immigrants and largely built by immigrants', 'Our diversity has always been our strength', 'It`s what creates', 'entrepreneurialism, in the nation all across America for our entire history', 'and in our best moments we have not of been afraid of immigrants', 'In our', 'worst moments we have', 'We have a Statue of Liberty standing in New York Harbor with that beacon of', 'light and hope saying, send us your tired and your hungry, send us you', 'huddled mass of yearning to breathe free', 'She stands for something', 'She', 'stands for the fact that this country has always welcomed it – not always,', 'its best moments welcomed immigrants and that is not what we`re seeing from', 'this president today', 'What he has done on the border is inhumane and intolerable', 'He is', 'separating families, children from parents, mothers from babies and locking', 'up people in facilities that are run by for-profit prison companies', 'It`s', 'an outrage', 'I would get rid of all that', 'That should not be under ICE, it', 'should not be under Homeland Security', 'Immigration is not a security issue', 'It is an economic and a humanitarian', 'and a family issue', 'So –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: – there is no such thing as an illegal human', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: I believe we have to fundamentally transform how we treat', 'people seeking asylum and refuge, because in my state and I know in your', 'state, you have immigrant populations across this state', 'Refugee', 'populations that make your economy stronger, that make your city and states', 'stronger, that makes this country stronger, we should not be afraid of', 'refugees and asylum seekers and mothers and babies seeking our help', '(APPLAUSE)', 'HAYES: I want to see if David has a follow-up question about immigration', 'policy', 'Yes', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, go ahead', 'DAVID SANCHEZ, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: Senator, thank you', 'Yes, I`m from one', 'of those immigrant communities you talk about, Southwest Detroit, born and', 'raised in Detroit', 'My grandfather came to Southwest Detroit in the 50s', 'just to make a better life for himself and his family and me, his grandson,', 'right, which is working out', 'So, I really appreciating him for that', 'And', 'there`s still family there that are making life for themselves, creating', 'that beautiful culture, diverse culture that you`re talking about, but', 'there`s also Michigan being right off of the border, border patrol and ICE', 'that is devastating families', 'A lot of earlier immigrants decades and centuries ago didn`t have to go', 'through a huge militarized police force to begin to start their lives here,', 'right', 'I know grandmothers that have been detained in detention, low', 'hanging fruit who check in with ICE all the time', 'I know grandmothers that', 'have tethers on their ankles, unfortunately', 'All right', 'And my question is to you – so for one, as a immigrant rights organizer, I', 'found a really great policy that – that I supported and tried to get the', 'senators in Michigan to support the DATA Act, which you sponsored', 'And', 'what that does is put some oversight on ICE and border patrol and collects', 'data of who they`re doing traffic stops for', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'SANCHEZ: Right', 'And that`s how we can see if it`s racial bias or anything', 'like that', 'And I`m wondering how you would get Democrats and Republicans', 'together – right now it seems like we`re so far to the right', 'A lot of', 'conservative people have taken the country a step backward', 'I`m wondering', 'how you can bring us back to do things that just make sense, to hold up our', 'freedoms and values that we hold so dear', 'GILLIBRAND: I think you have to talk about common ground', 'Because the', 'truth is everyone knows that diversity is a strength no matter where you go', 'in this country because they see it', 'So I would just remind them about why', 'immigration – and our story as Americans shows that our strongest and best', 'moments are when we welcomed immigrants and our lowest and darkest moments', 'are when we did not, – and remind people how important immigration is', 'But the bill that you mention is something that I authored because we have', 'a community and border too', 'And anyone here in Michigan knows we do', 'enormously great things with Canada', 'We have economics, we have businesses, cross-border transactions, we have', 'kids going on field trips', 'This is why our border matters and the way', 'people are treated at that border really matters, that`s why I authored the', 'legislation to say we need transparency and accountability, we need to know', 'how many times they`re stopping someone, what they`re stopping them for', 'Are they stopping them because they don`t like the color of their skin or', 'are they stopping them because they actually have a concern', 'That`s the', 'data we don`t have and that`s why I supported that bill, because we have to', 'get rid of institutional racism', 'And we have institutional racism in so many parts of our communities, we', 'see it in the criminal justice system but we also see it in every day', 'instances like healthcare, education and jobs', 'And this is one area where', 'I think transparency and accountability can help us', '(APPLAUSE)', 'HAYES: Nayyirah, do you have a question for Senator Gillibrand', 'NAYYIRAH SHARIFF, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: Yes', 'Today is the 1,780th day since', 'Flint residents have had clean drinking water', 'And actually next month', 'will be the fifth year anniversary since the switch', 'And over the course', 'of those five years we have residents who are facing multiple adverse', 'health issues around drinking water and being exposed to lead, bacteria and', 'other contaminants', 'And one of the issues at the federal level is one', 'there is no money or investment to invest in our infrastructure where we`re', 'constantly having contaminants being reintroduced into our water system', 'The other thing is we do not have any health-based standards at the federal', 'level', 'And how can you, one, ensure that there is long term recovery for Flint', 'residents, but because – not only do we have drinking water crises not', 'only within the state of Michigan but in other populations around the', 'country', 'So we`re also facing a burgeoning water affordability crisis –', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'SHARIFF: – because water is becoming more and more unaffordable for poor', 'income residents across the country', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'So I believe that clean air and clean water is a human', 'right, and I believe that every American should have access to it no matter', 'what', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: I – I – I`ve been serving on a committee that`s in charge of', 'clean water for 10 years', 'I have made clean water one of my absolute areas', 'of focus and priority', 'I have a bill that we`re hoping to introduce in', 'this Congress called the Pipe Sac (ph), to do exactly that, to give', 'communities like Flint, Michigan, to actually form water, because I know', 'you`re running out of access to bottled water and people can`t afford it', 'So you should have a right to clean water', 'The second thing we should do, is for other areas of degradation, I know', 'you have PFAS in your state, which is a chemical that`s used in fire', 'fighting foam, it`s also used in manufacturing, you have legacy pollution', 'throughout your state because of your history of manufacturing', 'Polluters', 'should be paying', 'They should also be paying for medical monitoring, and', 'this is what Flint resident`s need', 'You should have access as a matter of rights to full medical monitoring,', 'because whatever that – the toxins that your children, that your families', 'have drank during that entire time when you were exposed to toxins and', 'chemicals and led that are harming your children, your families and', 'yourselves, you should have a right to doctors that have the expertise and', 'that can monitor you over your lifetime and make sure you get the medical', 'help you need', 'That is what we put in place when we passed the 9/11 health bill, because', 'these were the first responders who raced up the towers and came down and', 'then breathed in all the toxins because EPA told them the air was safe', 'under George W', 'Bush', 'So, what we need, just like President Trump today, EPA is trying to roll', 'back every type of requirement should have clean air and clean water,', 'President Trump is letting polluters pollute and rolling back any', 'protections', 'And as President of the United States I would make clean air and clean', 'water a national priority and no one in Flint, Michigan would not have to', 'clean water and wouldn`t have access to basic medical support and medical', 'care', 'HAYES: We`ll be – thank you all for your questions', 'We`re going to be', 'right back here in Auburn Hills, Michigan, with more with Senator Kirsten', 'Gillibrand', 'Stick around', '(BREAK)', 'HAYES: We are back here with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in Auburn Hills,', 'Michigan, and I want to ask you a question and we`re going to take a few', 'from the audience before we wrap up here', 'This is a question that I get', 'from a lot of people - viewers emailing me', 'It has to do with Al Franken', 'There are people that e-mail me all the time who are angry at you because', 'they feel like you played some kind of untoured role in pushing out Al', 'Franken after allegations came out against him', 'And then in light of a New York Times story about a staffer on your staff', 'who complained about sexual harassment from someone else on your staff and', 'fought - and quit in protest of the handling of that issue which she felt', 'was not handled, and people have e-mailed be to say what does - what does', 'the Senator say about her own record when it comes to sexual harassment', 'GILLIBRAND: So I believe we as a society must value women', 'It`s so', 'important that we value women, which is why when a woman or a man comes', 'forward who has an allegation of sexual assault or sexual harassment that', 'you believe them, and that you do a full, thorough investigation so that', 'justice is possible', 'I`ve been taking on this cause throughout my Senate career, whether it', 'happens in the U', 'S', 'military where so many survivors are disbelieved and', 'not just disbelieved but they`re retaliated against', 'I take it on, on', 'college campuses because there are colleges across America who`d rather', 'shove it under the rug than have transparency and accountability', 'I take', 'it on in Congress, passing – with the help of many colleagues, including', 'Ted Cruz – a new sexual harassment bill for how Congress deals with sexual', 'harassment', 'In terms of my own office, the woman who came forward, she was believed,', 'her allegations were taken seriously, they were fully investigated', 'thoroughly and immediately', 'Her allegations did not rise to sexual', 'harassment but we did find evidence of derogatory comments', 'The person', 'that she alleges against was punished and this employee was dearly valued', 'I told her that she was loved by us, by our office, by personally, I hugged', 'her and she was deeply valued', 'In terms of Senator Franken, it was a very hard issue for so many', 'Democrats, because the truth is we miss him and people loved him', 'But he', 'had eight credible allegations against him of sexual harassment for', 'groping, two of them since he was a Senator and the eighth one that came', 'out was a congressional staffer', 'And I had a choice to make whether to stay silent or not, whether to say', 'it`s not OK with me, and I decided to say that', 'Now, Senator Franken was', 'entitled to whatever type of review or process he wanted, he could have', 'stuck it out, stayed in the Senate, gone through his ethics committee', 'investigation for as long as he wants, forget how many months', 'He could', 'have sued all of the eight women who came out against him', 'Those were his', 'choices', 'But I had to make my choice', 'Now, I am a mother of boys and the conversations I was having at home at', 'the time were very upsetting', 'Because Theo said to me, “Mom, why are you', 'so tough on Al Franken', '” And as a mother I had to be really clear, it is', 'not OK for anyone to grope a woman anywhere on her body without her', 'consent, it is not OK to forcibly to kiss a woman ever without her consent', 'It was not OK for Senator Franken, and it was not OK for you, Theo, ever', 'So I needed to have clarity', 'And if there are a few Democratic powerful', 'donors who are angry, because I stood up for women who came forward with', 'allegations of sexual harassment, that`s on them', '(APPLAUSE)', 'HAYES: Tell me your name and your question', 'NADA AL -HANOOTI, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: My name is Nada Al-Hanooti', 'I`m with', 'MDH USA, we`re a nonprofit

camp in Syria', 'She actually just', 'received her citizenship three days before Trump`s inauguration', 'So with', 'the Muslim ban happening, my mom feared traveling because she does not –', 'she does not speak English, and she was afraid of harassment from Homeland', 'Security giving her dual citizenship', 'And this fear is with her having', 'citizenship', 'And most of my community, the Muslim community does not have citizenship', 'and their fear – they have daily fears day to day with being deported,', 'being separated by their homes', 'And now with last week`s incidences we', 'have another layer – added layer of fear with New Zealand', 'Our place of solitude and sanctuary, the mosque, has now been compromised', 'My mom spends most of her time there', 'Our community members spend most of', 'their time there, and our president is not even defending us', 'He`s', 'promoting Islamophobia, and he does not see white nationalism as a threat', 'So my question to you is what will you do about white nationalism and will', 'you repeal the Muslim ban - that executive order for the Muslim ban', 'GILLIBRAND: I will stand up against white nationalism, and I will repeal', 'the Muslim ban as soon as I`m president of the United States', 'Now – but', 'to answer your broader question - to answer your broader question, one of', 'the reasons why I am running for president is because what Donald Trump has', 'done to this country', 'He`s made her family afraid to worship', 'He has', 'spread fear and hate and degradation across this country', 'He has spewed', 'hate, racism, anti-Semitism and has inspired more', 'Now, Donald Trump did not create hate and racism and bigotry and anti-', 'Semitism, but what he has done is poured fuel on a fire that is raging more', 'than I`ve ever seen it in my lifetime', 'Hate crimes have gone up', 'exponentially all across my state, all across the country, because of what', 'President Trump has unleashed', 'I had the courage to stand up for him - to stand up against him', 'I had the', 'courage to fight what needs to be done, because it`s not just about him', 'It`s the corruption and greed that destroys everything in Washington', 'It', 'makes it impossible to do the right thing, to make it impossible to end gun', 'violence, to make it impossible to pass healthcare as a right, not a', 'privilege, to make it impossible to take on the drug companies on the', 'opioid crisis', 'So that`s really what we`re up against', 'And so, each one of us has a choice today to say will we defend this', 'democracy', 'Will we as Americans fight for what we believe in', 'Will we as', 'Americans reject that hate that her family has to go through every day', 'Will we say this is not who we are as Americans', 'Will we take back that', 'right to vote

vote that'll come up in relatively short order\", 'SEN', 'GRAHAM: Right', \"Well, to not raise the debt ceiling could be a default of the United States' bond and Treasury obligations\", 'That would be very bad for, for the position of the United States in the world at large', 'But this is an opportunity to make sure the government is changing its spending ways', 'I will not vote for the debt ceiling increase until I see a plan in place that will deal with our long-term debt obligations, starting with Social Security , a real bipartisan effort to make sure that Social Security stays solvent, adjusting the age, looking at means tests for benefits', \"On the spending side, I'm not going to vote for debt ceiling increase unless we go back to 2008 spending levels, cutting discretionary spending\", 'MR', 'GREGORY: All right, but let me stop you for a second, Senator', 'SEN', \"GRAHAM: I think it's an opportunity\", 'MR', \"GREGORY: That's a big condition\", 'SEN',

retirement age , and means test benefits for older Americans', 'SEN', \"GRAHAM: I would suggest that if we're serious about taking America in a new direction, and you're not putting entitlement reform on the table, you've missed a great opportunity to change the course of America 's future\", 'And the last election was about change , Change that really will make us something other than Greece', 'I think Pat Toomey , Rand Paul , and other candidates who are new to the Congress have said during the campaign, \"Everything\\'s on the table when it comes to making America fiscally sound', '\" Let\\'s see if we can find bipartisan reforms in Social Security before we raise the debt limit', 'MR', 'GREGORY: But do you think Senator McConnell , the, the leader of the Republicans , is going to go along with that', 'SEN', 'GRAHAM: I hope so', 'I know that Speaker Boehner is going to produce spending limitation bills every day', \"But the question for the Republican Party , for the tea party

'I hope the -- that, that this new Congress will do something the other Congresses have never done, and that is seriously look at entitlement reform by adjusting the age and means assessing benefits, including Medicare Part D', 'Obama health care needs to be repealed and replaced', \"But the Republican Party created Medicare Part D , a prescription drug entitlement that's already gotten out of control\", \"I hope we'll put that on the table for reform\", 'MR', 'GREGORY: Would you vote, would you vote to actually scrap that, to take it away', 'SEN', 'GRAHAM: I would vote to means test it',

would vote to make sure that someone in my income level would have their Social Security benefits renegotiated if they're under 55, not in a Draconian way but changes that we can make now for people

said to the National Review last month', '\"President,\" -- this is about the government shutdown , but what you talked about was President Obama and his experience', 'And you said, \"I think he\\'s adrift', \"His instincts, I think, are to be more centrist, since that's the political future for him\", \"But he doesn't feel comfortable taking on his own party\", \"And he sure doesn't know how to

passed that were sort of liberal agenda policies that got votes or passed that really didn't change the job situation\", 'The president did agree to an extension of the tax cuts , but his initial entry into the agreement was whining', 'He accused us Republicans of being hostage takers, but he did change', 'When President Clinton was allowed to talk about the tax extension deal, I think that

'Holiday shopping was pretty robust, exceeding expectations, people buying a lot of Christmas gifts, spending a lot of money', 'That was good', 'But then you saw headlines like this in The Wall Street Journal , about housing , that issue I brought up with Senator Graham', 'This was the headline, \" Housing Recovery Stalls', '\" You\\'ve got a fall in home prices , interest rates going higher, that,

growth side, I think there's some areas where we can work with the president, some areas where it's going to be tough\", 'One area where we certainly can is trade', \"I think the president's finally gotten where he's happy with the South Korean trade agreement\", 'We certainly should get that done, get Colombia , get Panama done, and move on from there', 'I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines, but plenty of opportunities', 'Simplify the code, lower rates', 'We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now', 'We should lower the capital gains rate', 'We should have a territorial tax system , like the rest of the world does, so that we have a more competitive environment', 'Third thing I think we need to do, and this

that\", 'MR', 'GREGORY: E', 'J', \", let's talk about the president's leadership overall\", 'You wrote in your column something that caught my eye this past Thursday in terms of how people are feeling about the president', '\"The energy in our politics has shifted rightward,\" you wrote, \"with an abruptness that was inconceivable in the final weeks of the 2008 campaign, when Barack Obama could call a rally and count on tens of thousands to materialize almost at an instant', '\"If there is one thing the Obama White House most underestimates, it is the dispirited mood of its troops', \"This

years, it's clearly been on the conservative side\", 'So they have a kind of initiative in our politics', \"Now, I think there's an enormous opening here because one of the jobs in a democratic country is to hold people in power accountable\", 'For two years, we have held the president accountable', 'Democrats had all the power', 'Now, suddenly, Republicans control the House of Representatives , and they have more power in the Senate', \"And I think you're going to have a kind of accountability on the Republican side\", 'What are they actually for', 'Senator - elect Ayotte

kinds of subsidies', 'They say, \"No, we need this one', '\" Now, a good free marketeer like the Senator may join with some progressives and say, you know, \" Corporate socialism is a problem', '\" And so I think there is an opening to raise new issues now that the Republicans have some power', 'MR', \"GREGORY: Well, Stephen Carter , let's talk more broadly\", \"Something you write about in, in your book in the context of America 's wars, is also applicable here, and that is this concept of sacrifice\", 'You know, the lame-duck session featured this bipartisan deal over taxes where it was

lot, we're focusing this conversation, on short-term problems\", 'How to grow the economy this month, this year', \"That's natural\", \"People's home values are declining\", 'People are out of work',

session', 'Did they miss the message of the election', \"There's a lot of accommodation there, and you heard Senator Graham say it as well, that they didn't bargain for\", 'MS', 'KATTY KAY: No, absolutely', 'You\\'ve had tea partiers already saying that \"We\\'re disappointed with what Washington is doing,\" even since the election', \"And, of course, they're going to face now two new challenges on raising the debt ceiling and spending levels for the federal government , and it's going to be a test of tea party purity and of the new members that are coming in\", 'Are they actually going to make the decisions that are unpopular with the American people', 'I thought what you said, David , about you sacrifice', 'MR', 'GREGORY: Hm', 'MS', 'KAY:', 'is, is a critical issue of this', 'You cannot have it all', \"You cannot balance the budget , give people large tax cuts , as we have just done, and carry on with the spending programs that you've had\", \"And, you know, if you're not really going to address entitlements or the defense budget , then that's going to be tricky\", \"And it's very interesting to hear the senator- elect saying that he would go far on that and Lindsey Graham putting his neck out and saying he would address entitlement\", 'MR', 'GREGORY: Right', 'MS', \"KAY: But a lot of Republicans wouldn't\", \"You push them on what they would actually cut, and they're reluctant to do it\", 'MR', \"GREGORY: And, Senator - elect , I mean, here, here's the thing\", 'When Senator Graham says, \"I won\\'t vote for the debt ceiling until there\\'s agreement to deal with means testing Social Security and raising the retirement age ,\" is he really suggesting he\\'s going to hold out for Republicans to do that', 'I mean, do you see the political will to do something that dramatic in the next couple of months before you have to cast that vote on whether to raise the debt ceiling', 'SEN', \"-ELECT TOOMEY: I'm not sure that it has to be that specific\", 'MR', 'GREGORY: Mm-hmm', 'SEN', '-ELECT TOOMEY:', 'but I think it has to be very, very meaningful, with teeth', 'My, my suggestion is that when we contemplate raising the debt limit, we do it in small increments and we do it periodically, and every time we do it, we make sure we get a major concession, concession in the direction of limiting spending so that we can get this fiscal train wreck under control', \"We are on a disastrous path, there's just no question about it\", 'And so we need to take serious measures', \"And I , and I for one couldn't vote for an increase in the debt ceiling unless we are making really substantive progress on it\", 'MR', 'GREGORY: David -- yeah', 'MR', \"DIONNE: Although it's really strange that we say we want sacrifice and we want to get the deficit under control , yet Congress in this lame duck just voted to add about -- almost $900 billion to the deficit\", 'I think sacrifice is something legitimate to ask of all of us', 'We decided to wage two wars and cut taxes at the same time', 'And the only people really sacrificing are the men and women in uniform', 'But there are a lot of people out there who have sacrificed a lot in this recession', 'And so the instant you raise the word sacrifice , the question is, who are we going to ask that from', 'Who is it fair to ask that from', 'MR', 'GREGORY: Well', 'MR', 'BROOKS: I', 'SEN', '-ELECT TOOMEY: Can I', 'MR', 'GREGORY: Go, go ahead, David', 'MR', 'BROOKS: Yeah', \"I, I think the Republican Party has changed from say '95 or even last couple years when they weren't willing to sacrifice\", 'This is a Republican Party more dedicated to asking and to toughing -- talking about issues like entitlements, to really asking these kind of questions', \"And one of the issues that we're going to face just chronologically in the -- in, in February and March and April, Paul Ryan 's going to produce a budget that will have some serious budget cuts, and we will have a big debate over that\", 'At the same time, states all around the country are going to be going quasi bankrupt', \"So we're going to have a huge debate about the size of government\", \"And I think the Republican

the wrong -- personally, I just think this is the wrong way to construct this discussion and, and focus so much on the sacrifice', \"Let's remember, for instance, that under the current tax rates for the first four years in which they were fully in effect, from '04 through '07 inclusive, total government and federal spending was just below 20 percent of GDP , revenue was 17\", '5 percent on average, and we had deficits that were just barely over two percent of GDP , and half of that time below two percent', 'This was not excruciating suffering that the American people were going through in these years', 'And yet with these rates, we had deficits that were really quite manageable', 'We can do this again', 'Secondly, earmarks', 'I mean, I said from the beginning of my campaign, \"I will not ask for earmarks', 'This is a corrupt system, this is broken, this is wasting money', '\" And, and I got elected', 'I got almost no pushback on that issue', 'Now, some would say, \"Well, that means a great sacrifice', '\" Right', 'Well, evidently I think the public understands this is what you need to do', \"And the last point, on the entitlement reform , nobody's talking about making it go away\", \"We're talking about changing the structure\", \"So, for instance, the kind of reform of Social Security that I've advocated, give younger workers the opportunity to accumulate savings\", 'MR', 'GREGORY: But, Senator , but -- and, Stephen Carter , you speak to this', \"There's still so much focus on taxes\", 'Valerie Jarrett was here last week saying the president wants to make the tax cut issue an issue in 2012', 'Mitch McConnell saying, \"Yeah, bring it on', 'We want to have that debate in 2012', '\" We have a temporary truce here, but tax rates are still going to be a major debating ground', \"And again, we haven't taken anything away yet\", 'MR', \"CARTER: Well, it's true\", \"I don't want to say -- I, I think it's awkward to talk about asking for sacrifice\", \"Government doesn't ask for sacrifice , government tells people to sacrifice\", \"But putting that aside, I do think there's actually room for compromise even on the tax issue\", 'I think that most economists would agree', 'Our corporate taxes are the highest in the world', 'Our capital gains taxes unusually high compared to our competitors', \"And capital is fluid, it flows over borders, it'll go where the rates are low\", 'But our personal rates are relatively low compared to the rest of the world , and our tax base is shrinking', 'So it may be that the room for compromise is over time , not while the economy is still soft', 'As the economy strengthens, reducing corporate tax rates, reducing the capital gains tax rate, adding the tax base -- that is, taxing more people at, at a lower rate, the way the deficit commission wants to do that', 'Something like that, a compromise fashioned that way, I think, would help put our tax system in a rational, nonpartisan way', 'MS', \"KAY: That's what they're debating\", 'MR', \"BROOKS: That's exactly what they're debating\", 'MS', 'KAY: But the debate over the last few weeks suggests that there is such an allergy amongst Republicans to even discussing any kind of a tax increase that I wonder if there really is room for compromise on it', 'You know, compromise , when you poll people, they all say they want to compromise , or the majority of Americans say they want to compromise', 'When you push a little bit further, what they really mean is they want the other side to start agreeing with them', 'We heard Lindsey Graham saying exactly that', 'MR', 'GREGORY: Can I get one thought in here', 'I want to ask one question to E', 'J', ', where we began on the, on the president', \"You know, I still speak to liberals who feel this

been -- promised the kind of leadership -- or hasn't delivered the kind of leadership that he promised\", 'What does he do to deal with that sense among his core supporters', 'MR', \"DIONNE: Well, I think there's a dysfunction between the president and his core supporters\", \"He gets so impatient at people on the left, and there isn't a very big left in our country , who are doing their job,

it forgets that, wait a minute, 32 million people are going to get health care\", 'I think what he needs to do is to pick some arguments where he can make a case that economic growth and fairness go together', \"He's got to talk about innovation\", \"He's got to talk about investment, infrastructure, education, and say there is a place for the public sector to make the economy grow and to help people advance in the economy\", 'MR', 'GREGORY: Get -- getting the balance right', 'Right', 'MR', 'DIONNE:', 'and get that balance right', 'And that can appeal to middle of the road people and to his

between the managers and the populists\", \"So the managers are guys like Mitt Romney and Mitch Daniels , who are sort of elitist types, if you want to put it that way, though that's unfair, but who

Nothing has changed', \"The president can't change the law on his own\", 'This is not a permanent fix', 'This was prosecutorial discretion announced by the Department of Homeland Security, not a change in the law', \"So, this is going to allow our law enforcement agencies to focus on deporting criminal that's up 80 percent, by the way\", 'We need to focus on the real threat here, people who are endangering our communities, not people who are studying in school working hard', 'So, you have people who are brought here in many cases by young ages by their parents, who are studying in our schools, working in our businesses, who want to serve in our military', 'PLOUFFE: This allows them to apply just for a two-year period for work authorization', \"So, there's one way to fix this permanently, only one way, that's for Congress to pass the DREAM Act, which is something that unfortunately Governor Romney has said he would veto if he becomes president\", 'So, this is very, very important, that this is a two-year period so that people can apply', 'And it allows our law enforcement officials to focus on criminals who really posed a threat and ought to be the focus here', 'But

\"PLOUFFE: Well, first of all, Hispanic voters highly support the health care bill, what we're trying to do in education\", \"On immigration, yes, this is a president who's tried to get immigration done in a comprehensive way\", \"We're getting close to getting the DREAM Act done\", 'So, this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants', 'And that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that', 'Governor Romney has said he would veto the DREAM Act', 'Governor Romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home', 'They ought to self deport', \"So, this is someone you're not going to be able to trust\", 'And this one of the important choices that the president talked about earlier this week in Ohio', \"President Romney if he's elected is not going to fix our immigration system\", \"He's been very clear about that\", 'You watch Republican debate after Republican debate, many of them on your network, where Governor Romney was very clear, he would veto the DREAM Act', 'He thinks these 11 million people ought to just be sent home', \"So, I think that's a clear choice just not for the Latino community, but for the American electorate at large\", 'WALLACE: All right', \"Let's turn to the economy\", 'The president gave a major economic speech this week in Ohio in which he called for targeted investments for things like energy and education and state workers, first responders and teachers, and tax hikes for the wealthy', 'But there was -- forgive me -- nothing new', \"Is that the president's agenda for the next four years -- pass the jobs plan that I have been pushing for over the last 12 months and that will fix the economy\", 'PLOUFFE: What the president laid out is a clear choice facing the American people', 'And the contrast could not be clear', 'This is a president who believes we need to grow the economy by putting the middle class first, creating middle class jobs, by reducing the deficit in a fair or balanced way, and making sure we can invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and science and research', \"The congressional Republican approach, Governor Romney's approach -- by the way, it's fitting, he's with John Boehner today -- because Governor Romney is going to rubber stamp the Republican agenda, which basically gives huge tax cuts for the wealthy\", 'They believe the economy works best from the top down', \"That's failed\", \"By the way, Governor Romney wouldn't reduce the deficit\", \"Every independent economists who's looked at this plan says he would add to the deficit, he would starve investment in education, he would allow infrastructure to deteriorate even more\", 'This is not a recipe for growing the economy, reducing the deficit or helping the middle class', \"So, that's the stark choice --\", \"WALLACE: Does the president's agenda -- because I did not hear anything new in Ohio -- is the president's agenda for the next four years more of the same\", 'PLOUFFE: Well, what it is, is what this country needs to do, which is reduce the deficit in a right way, fair and balanced way', 'WALLACE: I like the fact that you keep saying fair and balanced', \"PLOUFFE: Well, it's the right way, which is we need to cut more spending\", 'This president has already signed into law, by the way, over -- almost $2 trillion on spending cuts', 'We have to focus on what is going to grow this economy for the middle class', \"And that's going to be continuing to focus on our manufacturing --\", 'WALLACE: But you would agree, there is no new agenda beyond what he is pushing for the last year', 'PLOUFFE: This is the direction he thinks that the country needs to go', \"Now, let's look at the other direction, it failed miserably\", 'When Governor Romney led Massachusetts, number one debt in the country -- think about that', 'Added debt', 'For all of this talk about government, for every private sector job created in Massachusetts by Governor Romney, six public sector jobs', 'This is someone who -- his state was 47 in job creation', 'And he wants to return to the same policies that led to the great recession that, you know, caused a huge harm to our businesses, our economy and people in this country', 'So, the choice is clear here', 'WALLACE: OK', 'PLOUFFE: The choice is clear', 'WALLACE: I have a couple of minutes left and I want to get to these campaign questions', 'You were the Obama campaign manager in 2008', \"I ask about whether there's anything new, because you are taking hits right now -- you, the campaign -- from some notable Democrats like James Carville and Bill Clinton, who are saying that you need to stop talking about the progress we've made and start talking about a new agenda, how things in the next four years are going to be different than they were in the last one\", 'Are they wrong', \"PLOUFFE: First of all, President Clinton, he's appeared with President Obama\", 'He said very clearly that we are beginning to grow again', \"We're beginning to make progress\", \"We can't return to the same policy\", \"President Clinton is someone knows something about reducing the deficit, about creating jobs, and he's been very clear -- he thinks Mitt Romney would be a disaster for this country\", \"So, listen, those other Democrats aren't paying attention to what the president said, which is everyday, not just on what he said, but what he does -- he understands our economy is not strong as it needs to be, that this didn't happen overnight, it's going to take us a long time to recover, there's a lot of people out there hurting\", 'So, we are making progress', 'We need to make a lot of more', \"That's very clear\", 'WALLACE: But you said, just a few months ago, that trajectory in the economy is going well', 'We had fewer and fewer jobs, each of the last four months', 'GDP growth is 1', '9 percent, 69,000 jobs, the lowest in the year created', 'The trajectory is not going like this anymore, sir', \"It's going like this\", 'PLOUFFE: Well, compared to where we were in recession we had over 4 million jobs created over the last 26 months', 'We had that private sector jobs --', \"WALLACE: But you've got three and a half years to fix it\", 'PLOUFFE: Well, listen, this is a deep hole caused by the same policies Mitt Romney wants to go back to', 'This is what folks need to focus on', 'We just went through recession', 'Remarkably, what Mitt Romney and the congressional Republicans want to do is, hey, I guess that worked out well', \"Let's go back to the same rules\", 'Let Wall Street writes its own rules, make it easier to polluters to foul our air more, huge tax cuts to people like Mitt Romney and basically paid for by raising taxes on working Americans, and making it harder for people to get education, not believing in the new energy future, not rebuilding this country', 'So, listen, this is a tough recession we are recovering from', 'We are making slow and steady progress', 'Nobody is satisfied', 'The president most of all knows we have to recover more quickly, create jobs more quickly', 'But the choice is, are we going to continue and move forward -- are we going to go back to the same policies that caused the recession', 'WALLACE: I got it', 'One last question --', \"PLOUFFE: It's important\", 'Nothing is more important than this, Chris', \"WALLACE: One more question real quickly, any chance you'll leave the White House, go back to Chicago and run this campaign\", 'PLOUFFE: No', 'Listen, the campaign is being run brilliantly by Jim Messina, by David Axelrod', 'And most importantly, our campaign is at its core, 2', '5 million Americans have already contributed, millions volunteer to elect this president -- teachers, retirees, students', 'Compare that to Mitt Romney whose entire campaign right now seemed to be on the backs on these big super PACs and billionaires trying to purchase the White House', \"It's a terrible thing for our country\", \"WALLACE: Why -- I can't let that go\", 'He raised $16 million more than in the last month than you did', 'PLOUFFE: Well, first of all --', \"WALLACE: And those were small contributors, limited contributors, they weren't the big super PACs\", 'Wait, wait, the Romney camp and the RNC raised $16 million more, $76 million', 'You raised $60 million', \"PLOUFFE: Well, what I'm saying, our campaign --\", 'WALLACE: What about that', \"PLOUFFE: Well, first of all, Mitt Romney won't even release who raises his money\", \"WALLACE: Wait, wait, you're not answering the question, sir\", 'PLOUFFE: They had a good month raising money', 'WALLACE: OK', 'But those were limited contributions', \"So, those weren't $10 million contribution\", 'PLOUFFE: If you compare our fundraising to his, we have a lot more grassroots volunteers', 'In Ohio, in Virginia, in North Carolina --', 'WALLACE: OK', \"PLOUFFE: -- the most active entity right now on the campaign is not Governor Romney, it's these super PACs\", 'The American panel --', 'WALLACE: I got to let the panel have time to talk', \"It's always a pleasure to talk to you\", 'Enjoy it',

'S', 'and Israeli joint cyber campaign against Iraq', 'Let me start with you, Senator Lieberman', 'How much damage has been done to our national security', 'LIEBERMAN: In my opinion, an enormous amount has been done to our national security', 'I mean, in the case of the cyber attack in Iraq, if the articles are true, this is the first confirmation of that', 'Some methods of how it was carried were telegraphed to the Iran', \"I think there's a danger that it may legitimize an Iranian or a terrorist counter cyber attack on us because we did it\", 'In the case of the underwear bomb from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- again, these leaks jeopardized that operation', 'Potentially put the individual who courageously infiltrated AQ in the Arabian Peninsula in danger and his family', 'This will discourage people and foreign intelligence services from cooperating with us in the future', \"Finally in the case of the Osama bin Laden kill, the fact that we leaked the story that a doctor was retained to carry out a vaccination program and trying to get DNA from people in bin Laden's compound led the Pakistanis to the doctor and he's now been convicted and sentenced to 333 years in jail\", 'Who is going to cooperate with us next time as a result of that', 'So, yes, these leaks compromise the security of every American', 'WALLACE: General Hayden, I want to pick up on what Senator Lieberman said', \"Are some of these leaks giving away what's known as sources and methods, the Holy Grail of intelligence, and especially in the case of alleged U\", 'S', '-Israeli cyber attack against Iran -- does it invite retaliation by the mullahs in Tehran', 'GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CIA: I think so', \"And to reiterate the point the senator made, these don't have to be true to be harmful\", 'So, you take the Stuxnet story', \"It's almost like --\", \"WALLACE: That's a computer virus that allegedly were used against the Iranians\", 'HAYDEN: Right', \"That's taunting the Iranians\", 'Imagine this -- my counterpart when I was director of CIA was (INAUDIBLE)', 'I can just picture him now going to the supreme leader Khamenei and saying, you know those things we discussed a year or two ago, Mr', 'Supreme Leader, and you told me to put them on the back burner', \"I think it's now time to resurrect those ideas\", 'I mean, it sort of legitimates an Iranian response, whether the story is true or false', 'WALLACE: General, in the cyber warfare story that appeared on the front page of \"The New York Times,\" you are quoted saying this, and let\\'s put it on the screen', '\"This is the first attack of a major nature in which a cyber attack was used to affect physical obstruction', 'Somebody crossed the Rubicon', '\"', \"Didn't you at least indirectly confirm the leak\", 'HAYDEN: No', 'In fact, I was quite clear', 'Totally agnostic as to who did this, but it is accepted knowledge and public knowledge that this happened', 'Whoever did it crossed a policy barrier, made a decision that in a time of peace, one could use cyber weapon to inflict physical destruction on what another nation could only describe as their own critical infrastructure', \"WALLACE: But in you're in no way confirm --\", 'HAYDEN: No', 'WALLACE: -- that the U', 'S', 'was involved', 'HAYDEN: No, not at all', 'WALLACE: OK', \"As we discussed with David

Senator Lieberman -- do you have thoughts about who was leaking these stories and why', \"LIEBERMAN: I don't have any thoughts about who is leaking the stories\", \"But we have to try to find out and that's what the investigation and the Justice Department ought to do\", \"There's nothing new here about leaks in Washington\", \"This happened during the Clinton and Bush administration and earlier Obama administration and Bob Woodward's books for instance\", 'But the recent series of leaks are the worst in the long time', \"I think run a slippery slope where people think there is no accountability if you leak and we've got to change that\", \"I think we've got to change the law that's applied here\", 'The last person to be convicted of a crime for leaking to the media was more than 25 years ago', 'We are using a 1917 Espionage Act that requires some showing of intent and knowledge that a leak would harm the security of the United States', 'But, Chris, if you -- it seems to me that the law ought to say simply: if you disclose without authority classified information, you committed a crime, because for information to be classified, there was a judgment made that its disclosure would cause damage in the case of top secret information, which a lot of these was, it would cause exceptionally grave damage to the security of the United States', 'So, this is something that has to be found', 'One last point: David Sanger says in the --', \"WALLACE: He was the fellow who wrote about the cyber warfare and he's written a book on this\", 'LIEBERMAN: Right', 'He says that his writing is based on conversations with high ranking officials in the U', 'S', \"government and other governments who don't want to be identified, because the information they shared is highly classified and relates to some ongoing operation\", \"That's an acknowledgment of a crime in my opinion and that's why the Justice Department ought to get to the bottom of this\", 'WALLACE: Let me follow on this with you, General Hayden, because you have been in these meetings', \"You've been in the Situation Room\", 'How closely held is this kind of information', 'You know, we are talking about sources and methods', 'We are talking about agents that we had in those countries', 'We are talking about a major campaign against Iran', 'How closely held is the information and do people just leave the room and go out on their own and leak this kind much information', \"HAYDEN: Well, they shouldn't certainly\", 'And this is very closely held information', 'Again, without commenting on whether the story is true or false', 'If you follow the storyline that David Sanger lays out, this would have been a covert action', 'Covert action requires the personal involvement of the president, his personal approval', 'And there are a few things in the American government that are as closely protected as covert actions are', 'I mean, after all, the word covert has some meaning', \"Or at least it's supposed to\", 'WALLACE: Do you think this was political', \"Do you this is an effort to shine the president's record foreign policy\", \"HAYDEN: On the Stuxnet leak and the Sanger article, first of all, I'm reluctant to pass judgment\", \"But I'll believe what David Sanger said\", \"This wasn't in any way a press from anyone, so to speak\", 'He picked this up in bits and pieces through very good reporting', \"But that, however, doesn't indicate that some of that reporting didn't come from sources who were privy to this information\", 'WALLACE: Senator Lieberman, let me ask you some of the questions that I asked David Plouffe', 'Do you think that the president should, as George W', 'Bush did, order his entire staff, anyone who knows about those leaks, come forward', 'LIEBERMAN: I do', 'I mean, the president made very clear in the statement that you played earlier that he was outraged and anybody would think that anybody in his White House who was leaking classified information', 'I think the next step is ask all of them to come forward in just the way you said', 'WALLACE: You think he should agree, as President Bush did, to sit down with federal prosecutors for interrogation', \"LIEBERMAN: Well, that's up to him\", 'But, look, we are in a situation where I think the administration ought to do everything it can to eliminate any appearance that people in the administration leaked this highly classified information for political or other personal purposes', \"And I leave it to the president's attorneys\", \"But If I were advising him, I'd say he should sit down and talk to the investigators\", 'WALLACE: Finally, back in 2003, you said that we needed a special prosecutor and independent counsel in the Valerie Plame case', 'Given the extent of these leaks and the fact that top administration officials, not by name but are quoted as having been the sources, does there need to be a special prosecutor', \"LIEBERMAN: Chris, I've been thinking about this since these leaks came out\", 'And I reached a conclusion, which is that we do need a special counsel and we need a special counsel because special counsel avoids any appearance of conflict of interest', 'Special counsels, independent counsels, were created for a situation like this, where people might reach a conclusion that investigators, U', 'S', 'attorneys even, working for the attorney general, who was appointed by the president, cannot independently and without bias investigate high officials of their own government', 'WALLACE: So you are saying the U', 'S', 'attorneys that have been appointed by General Holder, Attorney General Holder, not enough special prosecutor', 'LIEBERMAN: Yeah, not enough', 'And I have no reason to distrust or disrespect either of these U', 'S', 'attorneys', 'But here we got one gentleman who gave a contribution to President Obama', 'No matter what he concludes, people are going to say it was biased', \"Here's the big difference between a regular U\", 'S', 'attorney and a special counsel, the special counsel is not under the day-to-day supervision of the Attorney General, he is really much more independent', \"And I think that's what -- frankly I think Attorney General Holder would do the administration and himself a favor if he appointed special councils in this case because it would remove any appearance that anybody in the administration was trying to block a full scale investigation and protect anybody in the administration who may have leaked\", \"WALLACE: We're going to have to leave it there\", 'Senator Lieberman,

necessitated only because all three combinations of I-80 have been used, the Committee has a further option to offer for your consideration', 'If the I-580 designation were continued from Castro Valley to San Lorenzo and then used in place of the proposed I-880 designation northerly to Oakland and over existing I-180 between Albany and San Rafael, then existing I-580 between Castro Valley and Oakland could be designated I-180', 'The Committee does recognize this option would involve considerable resigning, however', \"Caltrans' Division of Highways and Programming Chief Donald Watson replied in a letter dated July 27, 1983, as follows:\", 'We already have a state route 180 in our Fresno area, and this route is separated from I-580 in Castro Valley by about 100 miles', 'We are therefore unable to recommend the designation of existing I-580 between Castro Valley and Oakland as I-180', 'On a related note, some years ago there was a proposal put forth to build a bay crossing that would have linked I-238 with I-380 near San Francisco Airport', 'That would have easily eliminated the I-238 mess', \"I don't know what became of that plan\", 'The above correspondence should prove that I-238 is not a flagrant violation that was allowed to occur just for the fun of it', 'While AASHTO did have the legitimate suggestion of using I-180 instead, the reply points out that 180 was an already established number', 'It also shows that AASHTO conceded that resigning the route as I-580 would be expensive, at least in the sense that considerable resigning would be required', 'Of course, the most important piece of information is that AASHTO did approve it', 'The story of the number 480 is quite a bit different, however', 'When I-238 was conceived, 480 had already been assigned to that god-awful monstrosity, the Embarcadero Freeway, known otherwise as the \"World\\'s Longest Off-ramp', '\" In my opinion, if 480 had come to its full fruition before San Francisco blocked it, it would have been such a complete disaster', \"It was supposed to skirt the waterfront between the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, which I think would have seriously tarnished San Francisco's charm\", 'Anyway, SR-480 started its life as I-480, being designated as such between its completion in 1957 and August, 1965', 'Apparently someone realized what a travesty this freeway was and that it did not even deserve to be called an Interstate, resulting in its redesignation as SR-480', 'As is well known, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake condemned this freeway, much to the joy of just about everyone except for Caltrans', 'Route 480 (its ghost and all) was finally put to rest in 1991 and deleted from the state highway system, certainly with tears of sorrow from the eyes of Caltrans engineers falling on the order', 'While 480 is available now, it certainly was not back in 1988, which left I-238 as a remotely reasonable alternative', \"I-480 could rise from its ashes and replace I-238, but that will almost certainly not happen, and I'll explain why shortly\", 'So What Could or Should be Done', \"I've heard a lot of proposals for the future disposition of I-238\", 'Renumber it, say to I-480', 'Have it revert to being signed as a state highway', 'Renumber I-580 to I-705', 'Keep I-238 and build an I-338 to help alleviate traffic on I-680', 'And so on', 'I happen to think there is a lot of merit to these suggestions (although I-338 may be a little extreme as of yet), but I think the wisest course of action would be to leave it alone', 'Like it or not, I-238 is a legitimate Interstate; it was approved by AASHTO', 'Bear in mind that AASHTO is the organization that is responsible for maintaining and assigning the numbers for Interstate (as well as US) highways', \"This is significant since I-99, Bud Schuster's loathsome, detestable and vile pork barrel highway that it is, was designated by law, by brute force\", 'As I understand it, that means it never had to be legitimized by AASHTO', 'So if Mr', \"Schuster wanted, he could have had his little project designated as Interstate 1 (which I'm surprised he didn't since he obviously thinks he is #1) or even as I-38 without having to be accountable to anyone but himself\", 'So say what you might about I-238, but remember that Caltrans did not play God and had to have AASHTO approve it', \"I'm sure AASHTO did not approve it just for the heck of it\", 'There are some compelling arguments to be made for renumbering I-238', 'The I-480 designation has now been freed up and could be applied to that section of highway', 'It is a perfect candidate for an even numbered \"3di\" as it forms a (small) loop', 'It starts at I-880 and ends at I-580; a even numbered 3di in theory starts and ends at an Interstate, whether it is a parent or daughter route', 'It would also make it somewhat noteworthy as it would be one of the few 3dis that does not touch its parent Interstate, much like I-380', 'However, I feel that even this solution is not needed and could very well prove impractical', 'I-480 is deeply entrenched in the minds of people in the Bay Area', 'Even though it no longer exists, it would certainly cause some confusion if it were to be reincarnated', 'Perhaps more to the point, it would bring a lot of the old antagonism back to the surface from its days as the Embarcadero Freeway; antagonism that is best left in the past', 'From here, the suggestions grow more extreme and more complex', 'Renumber I-580 to something like I-305 and apply the I-580 designation to what is now I-238', 'While this suggestion makes a good deal of sense and is perfectly \"legal\" as far as the numbering scheme is concerned, it is something that would have made more sense to do in the early 1960s before I-580 was established in the first place', \"Don't get me wrong here; I think I-305 (or I-705) is a much better choice for that stretch of highway than I-580\", 'The cost of resigning all 76 miles of I-580 would be significant, to say the least', 'The overheads would have to be redone and all the shields (which cost Caltrans $25+ a pop) on all the on-ramps and along the freeway would have to be replaced', 'What is of more pressing concern is the confusion that such a renumbering would create', \"It's one thing if I-580 were to disappear altogether; it's another that it becomes a two mile long freeway right next to its former location\", 'The confusion that would be created by renumbering this 40+ year old freeway would be incredible - and costly', 'Getting rid of I-238 is not important enough to merit a solution like that', 'Scott Oglesby (\"Kurumi\") has suggested building another x-38 in the Bay Area; I-338', 'This is a one-way \"toll free\" freeway that ends one mile into the San Francisco Bay off of Fremont', 'This would legitimize (to an extent) I-238 and solve a very nasty traffic problem', 'However, I think there are those who may have a moral objection to sending Bay Area commuters to the bottom of San Francisco Bay, although I have a moral objection to not doing so', 'Nevertheless, this would probably not go over too well, especially with Bay Area commuters who may take a dim view to such a traffic solution', 'A sensible suggestion, and to me the only feasible one, would be to renumber I-238 to I-980', 'SR-24 could once again extend south to I-880 as it did before', 'The cost of replacing shields would be very minor and there would not be a lot of confusion since most of I-980 is marked either as \"To I-580\", \"To I-880\", or simply as \"SR-24 North', '\" My only objection, and this reaches to the crux of my argument, is that it simply is not worth doing; it is not worth changing I-238 to anything, especially since it is such a short highway', \"Then again, the more I think about it, the more I realize that transferring I-980 and restoring SR-24 makes a lot of sense, enough I'm sure to render my arguments moot\", \"Realistically (and in the end that's what counts), I think any Caltrans engineer would laugh his head off when told to change I-238\", \"There are many more solutions to this that people have come up with and I'll list a few more\", 'As mentioned in Mr', \"Rouse's email, there was a proposal to build a new Bay Bridge between I-380 on the west and Route 238 on the East Bay\", 'A quick glance at the map showed me that this would have been built across the widest part of the bay, making it less than feasible', 'This would have been nice, though, since it would have eliminated I-238, replacing it with I-380 and it would have helped Bay Area commuters', 'Some of the others did not seem so reasonable', 'I heard proposals by road buffs to have an I-3 in place of US 101 or to extend I-70 west', \"The only real purpose for creating these would be to add more 3di's for the sole purpose of eliminating I-238\", \"C'mon, it's just a trivial thing; not worth throwing a lot of money at\", \"I think I've made my point\", 'The bottom line is that there are no reasons compelling enough to go to the expense and effort of redesignating I-238, loathsome as it may be to some', \"In all honesty, 99% of the population neither knows nor cares what Route 238 is; whether it's an Interstate highway, a state highway, or signed by a mauve rhombus shaped shield with paisley, polka dots and lots of pretty flowers\", 'All they care about is that I-238 gets them to where they need to go without too much trouble or confusion', 'For better or worse, I-238 does its job and is certainly here with us to stay', 'While it is in violation of the numbering convention, there are a lot of legitimate reasons for it being so and its existence should not be considered offensive, just unique', 'If that does not put things into context, then I suggest comparing it with I-99', 'After all, at least there are good reasons for I-238 to exist', 'Links to Related Pages', 'Here are some other pages related to

New Hampshire\\'s senior Senator Judd Gregg, who\\'s undecided, and says to your comments that you are part of the know-nothing wing of the political spectrum', 'In the meantime, the president says his plan is the last best chance for serious immigration reform', \"He's criticized conservatives for being obstructionists\", 'With that tension at stake, if this becomes law, what are the consequences for the country', 'TANCREDO: They are incredible, and they are disastrous', \"And that is exactly why I have said what I've said, and that is why I have consistently tried to impress upon the American public the seriousness of this issue\", \"We're not just talking about the number of jobs that we may be losing or the number of kids that are in our schools and impacting our school system or the number of people that are abusing our hospital system and taking advantage of the welfare system in this country\", \"We're not just talking about that\", \"We're talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation: whether or not we will actually survive as a nation\", \"And here's what I mean by that\", \"What we're doing here in this immigration battle is testing our willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces\", 'We are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the English language, something that is the glue that is supposed to hold us together as a nation', 'We are becoming a bilingual nation', 'And that is not good', 'And that is the fearful part of this', \"The ramifications are much, much more significant than any that we've been discussing so far\", 'And so, yes, I have said dramatic things', 'And, yes, I am willing to do whatever is necessary to try to stop this piece of legislation', 'And that includes go after any Republican that votes for it, because the Republicans can stop this', 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Mayor Giuliani, what do you think the consequences for the nation are if this immigration plan proposed by President Bush goes through', 'GIULIANI: The problem with this immigration plan is it has no real unifying purpose', \"It's a typical Washington mess\", \"It's everybody compromises -- four or five compromises\", 'And the compromises leave you with the following conclusion: The litmus test you should have for legislation is, is it going to make things better', 'And when you look at these compromises, it is quite possible it will make things worse', 'The organizing purpose should be that our immigration laws should allow us to identify everyone who is in this country that comes here from a foreign country', 'They should have a tamper-proof I', 'D', 'card', \"It should be in a database that allows you to figure out who they are, why they're here, make sure they're not illegal immigrants coming here for a bad purpose, and then to be able to throw out the ones who are not in that database\", 'We can

lives -- not necessarily as citizens; they have to wait 13 years to become citizens', \"That's not the point\", 'The point is: Every illegal alien, almost every one, under this bill, gets to stay here', \"That's not fair to the millions and millions of people around the world that would love to come here, join with family members, bring skill and education that we need\", \"It's simply not

national security issue\", 'People came to Fort Dix, New Jersey, from across our southern border and tried to kill our soldiers', 'For us to do nothing is silent and de facto amnesty', \"What we have

done', \"So let's make sure that we enforce the law as it exists\", 'And if you want to improve this bill, well, one thing you could do to make it better is to take that Z visa and make it temporary

let's go back to Tom for another question on immigration\", \"FAHEY: Congressman Hunter, whether we like it or not, in cities across America, counties across America, including your district in San Diego, illegal immigrants are doing jobs that American citizens don't want, working on farms, in hotels, restaurants\", \"If you have your way and they all leave this country, who's going to fill those jobs\", 'HUNTER: Well, first, I disagree with that premise, because when they made the sweep on the Swift plants -- those were the meat- packaging plants in Iowa; took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago -- there were American citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour', 'And let me tell you, this is a disastrous bill', 'And John McCain is right in saying that this is a national security issue', 'And it is: border enforcement', 'Then the Hunter bill, which was signed by the president on the 26th of October, mandating 854 miles of double fence -- not that scraggly, little fence you show on CNN all the time, Wolf, that people get across so easily', 'If they get across my fence, we sign them up for the Olympics immediately', '(LAUGHTER)', \"We've got a big fence\", 'But 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed', 'Homeland Security has a billion bucks, cash on hand', \"It's been six months, and they've done 11 miles\", 'So this administration has a case of the slows', 'And I think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time, put the two together, and the Bush-McCain-Kennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike', \"It's a bad bill\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Senator Brownback, what do you say about this notion of a pathway toward citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now', 'Under what circumstances would you let them begin that path', \"BROWNBACK: I don't think you create any new paths to citizenship\", 'But I also think you allow them to be able to use paths that they would currently qualify for, and to be able to get in the back of the line', \"And that's part of leadership and getting something resolved\", 'I think, you know, we can go on a lot of slogans here', \"And I've been around this issue for a while\", 'I was in Congress in 1994, elected then', 'We did the first immigration bill I was involved in then in 1996', 'You know what', 'That was an enforcement-only bill in 1996', 'And we had 7 million undocumented here in the country then', \"We're at 12 million to 20 million now\", 'The point of saying that -- and my colleagues and people up here, everybody is concerned that we get something done and get something right', \"I think if you do exterior enforcement, border enforcement, you do aggressive interior enforcement, and then you work on a comprehensive solution interior, that's something that a lot of people are going to be upset with but that can work and move us forward\", \"And it's better than not doing anything\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'So you support this pending compromise legislation', 'BROWNBACK: If we can hold together those things in it', 'Those things have to be in it', \"BLITZER: You're with Senator McCain\", 'BROWNBACK: If those things are in it', 'BLITZER: What about you, Governor Thompson', \"THOMPSON: Wolf, the first thing you have to do is you've got to secure the border\", 'Securing the border is going to allow everything else to follow', 'But unless you secure the border, it is not right to give 12 million individuals who have illegal rights in this country status before that border is protected', 'There should be no amnesty', 'And this bill, no matter how you cover it, is an amnesty bill', 'And the people in this country do not believe in that bill', 'And they believe very much that the best hope for us to have a secure border, just like Congressman Hunter has been talking about and every other Republican up here', 'Have a secure border, then move on', \"But don't do it the other way\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', 'Congressman Paul, I want you to weigh in on this as well', \"I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- you voted to support that 700-mile fence along the border between the United States and Mexico\", 'Did you', 'PAUL: I did', 'BLITZER: What about Canada', 'Is there a need for a similar fence along the border between', 'PAUL: No', 'BLITZER:', 'the United States and Canada', 'PAUL: No, because that bill -- probably the fence was my weakest reason for doing that, but for other reasons, to enforce the law was important', 'And border security is important', \"And we talked about amnesty, which I'm positively opposed to\", 'But one thing that has not been mentioned here, which I think is very, very important: If you subsidize something, you get more of it', 'So we subsidize illegal immigration', 'We reward it by easy citizenship, either birthright or amnesty', 'But we force our states and our local communities to pay for the health care, to pay for the education', \"Why wouldn't they bring their families\", 'And because of our economic conditions, we do need workers', 'But if we had a truly free-market economy, the illegal immigrants would not be the scapegoat', 'We would probably need them, and they would be acceptable', 'But because of economic conditions, they have become the scapegoat', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: The other night, Sunday night, I asked the eight Democratic presidential candidates whether or not they thought English should be the official language of the United States', 'Only one of them said English should be the official language of the United States', \"If there's someone here who doesn't believe English should be the official language of the United States, please speak up right now\", \"MCCAIN: I think it's fine\", 'I would like to remind you that we made treaties with Native Americans such as the Navajos in my state, where we respect their sovereignty and they use their native language in their deliberations', \"It's not a big deal\", 'But Native Americans are important to me in my state', 'Everybody knows that English has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder', 'That is obvious', 'And part of our legislation, by the way, is a requirement to learn English', 'And by the way, 30 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never came across our borders, my friends', 'They overstayed their visas', \"That's why it has to be a comprehensive approach\", \"And I'm proud of the support of the president and his brother, Governor Jeb Bush, who was governor of the state of Florida\", 'People who have to deal with this issue every day understand we have to act, my friends', 'And we can have our own ways to improve it', \"But if we don't address this issue, we are going to pay a heavy price\", 'Because something bad could happen when 12 million people are in this country illegally, 2 million of them having committed serious crimes', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: I see people raising their hands', \"But the question was, I'd only like those to speak up who believe that English should not necessarily be the official language of the United States\", 'Is there anyone else who stands with Senator McCain specifically on that question', 'All right', \"We're going to go back to Scott\", 'Go ahead, Scott', '(CROSSTALK)', 'BLITZER: Scott, go ahead', \"HUNTER: Wolf, if I've got -- if I have reservations in my district, can I speak up also\", \"BLITZER: You'll have an opportunity\", 'Go ahead, Scott', 'SPRADLING: OK', \"This question's for Governor Gilmore\", 'Conservative credentials is the topic, sir', \"You've gotten a lot of mileage out of lumping Messrs\", 'Giuliani, McCain and Romney together by calling them Rudy McRomney', '(LAUGHTER)',

ticket\", \"And we don't know what Fred Thompson is either\", \"I think he's a fine man\", 'He served in the Senate a term and a half', \"Let's see exactly what his views are\", \"I'm coming forward and offering my views as a 40-year battler for conservative values and conservative principles on behalf of the people of the United States\", 'And I have the record to back it up', \"I've been a prosecutor\", \"I've been an attorney general\", \"I've been a governor\", 'I governed as a conservative', 'I cut taxes for the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia', \"I've stood by these principles for years and years\", 'The question is that when Fred Thompson comes into the race, as I believe he will -- and maybe even Speaker Gingrich may come into the race', \"They'll have to stand on their records and stand on their credentials and offer their ideas the same way that every person here on the stage is doing\", 'I look forward to that day, and I look forward to the debate',

want to get involved', \"It's a great name\", \"He's a great candidate\", 'And I think it will help the Republican Party to have him in', \"I just would like to say that if you're talking about conservatism -- and that's what you're talking about -- there isn't a candidate on either side of the aisle that has had as many vetoes as I have\", 'Nobody has reduced taxes as much as I have', \"And if you're talking about a reliable conservative, it is this Thompson, Tommy Thompson, not the other, that's the conservative\", '(LAUGHTER)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', 'Thank you, Governor', 'Mayor Giuliani, there was some news here today', \"A Catholic bishop in Rhode Island said some words about your position on abortion, suggesting that it was similar to Pontius Pilate's personal opposition to Jesus Christ's crucifixion, but allowing it to happen anyway\", 'How does that make you feel when you hear words like that from a Catholic bishop', 'GIULIANI: Well, Catholic bishop -- any religion (inaudible)', \"BLITZER: That's the lightning that's having an effect on our system\", 'GIULIANI: I know', '(LAUGHTER)', \"I guess I'm here by myself\", \"Look, for someone who went to parochial schools all his life, this is a very frightening thing that's happening right now\", '(LAUGHTER)', 'But the reality is I respect, you know, the opinion of Catholic (inaudible) and religious leaders of all kinds', 'Religion is very important to me', \"It's a very important part of my life\", \"But ultimately, as (inaudible) been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law, I've got to make the decisions that I think are the right ones in a country like ours\", \"And my view on abortion is that it's wrong, but that ultimately government should not be enforcing that decision on a woman\", 'That is my view that I -- I consult my religion', 'I consult my reading of the Constitution', 'I consult my views of what I think are important in a pluralistic society, and the reality that we have to respect the fact that there are people that are equally as religious, equally as moral, that make a different decision about this, and should government put them in jail', 'BLITZER: You made, Governor Romney, this decision on abortion, opposing abortion, relatively recently', 'Why should conservatives out there, people who oppose abortion, believe you', 'ROMNEY: Well, people can look at my record', \"I'm not going to apologize for the fact that I became pro-life\", 'I served as governor', 'As I was governor, as we were debating cloning and as we were debating also embryo farming, I said Roe v', 'Wade has gone too far', \"I want to make it very clear that I'm pro-life\", 'People here in New Hampshire have seen that I fought for life', 'I fought also for traditional marriage, to keep taxes down, to have education in our schools that includes abstinence education', \"I've fought for English immersion in our schools\", \"They know that I've got conservative credentials\", \"And that's one of the things that brings me to this race\", \"But there's something bigger in conservatism that I don't think we've spoken about\", 'And that is that

century', 'BLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor', \"Let's go back to Tom for the next question\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'FAHEY: (inaudible) do not believe in evolution', \"You're an ordained minister\", 'What do you believe', 'Is it the story of creation, as it is reported in the Bible or described in the Bible', \"HUCKABEE: It's interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president\", \"I'm not planning on writing the curriculum for an 8th-grade science book\", \"I'm asking for the opportunity to be president of the United States\", \"But you've raised the question, so let me answer it\", 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth', \"To me, it's pretty simple\", 'A person either believes that God created this process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own', 'And the basic question was an unfair question, because it simply asked us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed, in my view, whether there is a God or not', 'Well, let me be very clear: I believe there is a God', \"I believe there's a God who was active in the creation process\", \"Now, how did he do it and when did he do it and how long did he take, I don't honestly know\", \"And I don't think knowing that would make me a better or a worse president\", \"But I'll tell you what I can tell this country: If they want a president who doesn't believe in God, there's probably plenty of choices\", \"But if I'm selected as president of this country, they'll have one who believes in those words that God did create\", 'And as the words of Martin Luther, here I stand', 'I can do no other', 'And I will not take that back', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Governor, but I think the specific question is, do you believe literally it was done in six days and it occurred 6,000 years ago', 'HUCKABEE: No, I did answer that, Wolf', \"I said, I don't know\", \"My point is, I don't know\", \"I wasn't there\", '(LAUGHTER) But I believe, whether God did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time, he did it', \"And that's what's important\", 'But, you know, if anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate, they are certainly welcome to do it', \"I don't know how far they will march that back\", 'But I believe that all of us in this room are the unique creations of a god who knows us and loves us, and who created us for his own purpose', '(APPLAUSE)', \"BLITZER: Senator Brownback, you recently elaborated on your position on this, and I wonder if you'd want to spend 30 seconds and tell our audience out there where you stand on the issue of evolution\", \"BROWNBACK: I'd be happy to\", \"And it's interesting that we're doing this here at St\", \"Anselm's, who this -- that saint had a philosophy of faith seeking reason\", \"And that's the issue that's missing here, if I could highlight that point, is that I believe that we are created in the image of God for a particular purpose\", 'And I believe that with all my heart', \"And I'm somebody, I've had cancer in the past, I've had a season to really look at this and study it and think about the end of life\", \"And I am fully convinced there's a god of the universe that loves us very much and was involved in the process\", \"How he did it, I don't know\", \"One of the problems we have with our society today is that we've put faith and science at odds with each other\", \"They aren't at odds with each other\", 'If they are, check your faith or check your science, and we should have a discussion', 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'BROWNBACK: And we should engage faith and reason like St', 'Anselm did', 'BLITZER: Thank you', \"BROWNBACK: That's something we should do\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator Brownback', '(APPLAUSE)', \"Senator McCain, do you believe creationism should be taught alongside evolution in the nation's schools\", \"MCCAIN: No, I believe that that's up to the school districts\", 'But I think that every American should be exposed to all theories', \"But I can't say it more eloquently than Pastor Huckabee -- Governor Huckabee just did\", 'And I admire his description because I hold that view', \"The point is that the time before time, there's no doubt in my mind that the hand of God was in what we are today\", 'And I do believe that we are unique, and I believe that God loves us', 'But I also believe that all of our children in school can be taught different views on different issues', 'But I leave the curricula up to the school boards', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator, for that', 'Governor Romney, there was a recent poll here in New Hampshire', \"Ten percent said they wouldn't vote for you because you're a Mormon\", 'And last week, we saw that picture of that man

some time ago said he was not a Catholic running for president, he was an American running for president', \"And I'm happy to be a proud member of my faith\", \"You know, I think it's a fair question for people to ask, what do you believe\", \"And I think if you want to understand what I believe, you could recognize that the values that I have are the same values you'll find in faiths across this country\", 'I believe in God, believe in the Bible, believe Jesus Christ is my savior', 'I believe that God created man in his image', 'I believe that the freedoms of man derive from inalienable rights that were given to us by God', \"And I also believe that there are some pundits out there that are hoping that I'll distance myself from my church so that that'll help me politically\", \"And that's not going to happen\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor, for that', 'Congressman Paul, you ran for president once before as a libertarian', 'What do you say about this whole issue of church and state and these issues that are coming forward right now', 'PAUL: Well, I think we should read the First Amendment, where it says, \"Congress shall write no law,\" and we should write a lot less laws regarding this matter', \"It shouldn't be a matter of the president or the Congress\", 'It should be local people, local officials', \"The state should determine so many of these things that we just don't need more laws determining religious things or prayer in schools\", 'We should allow people at the local level', \"That's what the Constitution tells us\", \"We don't need somebody in Washington telling us what we can do, because we don't have perfect knowledge\", \"And that's the magnificence of our Constitution and our republic\", \"We sort out the difficult problems at local levels, and we don't have, you know, one-case-fit- all\", 'Because you have a Supreme Court ruling, like on Roe v', 'Wade, it ruined it for the whole country', \"And that's why we shouldn't have it at a central level\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', \"Let's go back to another question from Tom\", 'FAHEY: This is for Mayor Giuliani', 'Sea levels around the world are rising', 'Average temperatures are increasing', 'A U', 'N', 'report written by scientists from 113 countries recently said that climate change is very likely man-made and may affect us for centuries to come', 'Is science wrong on global warming', 'And what, if any, steps would you take as president to address the issue of climate change', 'GIULIANI: I think we have to accept the view that scientists have, that there is global warming, and that human operation, human condition contributes to that', 'And the fact is that there is a way to deal with it and to address it in a way that we can also accomplish energy independence, which we need as a matter of national security', \"It's frustrating and really dangerous for us to see money going to our enemies because we have to buy oil from certain countries\", 'We should be supporting all the alternatives', 'We need a project similar to putting a man on the moon', 'That project started with Eisenhower', 'It was carried out by Kennedy and then Johnson and then Nixon', 'And that was two Democrats and two Republicans working (inaudible) Democrats working in the national interest', 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'Thank you, Mayor', 'I want Governor Romney to weigh in as well', \"There's a perception, at least among some, that Republicans are -- at least the Republican Party -- very close to big oil\", 'A lot of Americans are suffering now from the price of gasoline -- high price of gasoline', \"What do you say to the audience out there who believes that there's too much of an alliance, if you will, between the big oil companies and Republicans\", 'ROMNEY: Well, first of all, Rudy Giuliani is right, in terms of an Apollo project to get us to energy independent', 'And the effects of that on global warming are positive', \"It's a no-regrets policy\", \"It's a great idea\", 'Secondly, with regards to big oil, big oil is making a lot of money right now', \"And I'd like to see them using that money to invest in refineries\", \"Don't forget that when companies earn profit, that money's supposed to be reinvested in growth\", 'And our refineries are old', 'Someone said to me -- Matt Simmons, an investment banker down in Houston -- he said, \"Our refineries today are rust, with paint holding them up', '\"', \"And we need to see these companies, if they're making that kind of money, reinvest in capital equipment\", \"But let's not forget that where the money is being made this year is not just -- and throughout these years -- is not just in Exxon and Shell and the major oil companies\", \"It's in the countries that own this oil\", 'Russia last year took in $500 billion by selling oil', 'Ahmadinejad, Putin, Chavez -- these people are getting rich off of people buying too much oil', \"And that's why we have to pursue, as a strategic imperative, energy independence for America\", 'And it takes that Apollo project', 'It also takes biodiesel, biofuel, ethanol', 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'ROMNEY:', 'cellulosic ethanol, nuclear power, more drilling in ANWR', 'We have to be serious also about efficiency', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', \"ROMNEY: And that's going to allow us to become energy- independent\", 'BLITZER: Senator McCain, do you have a problem at this time with these oil companies making these huge profits', 'MCCAIN: Sure', 'I think we all do', 'And they ought to be reinvesting it', 'And one of the areas that they ought to be involved in is nuclear power', 'Nuclear power is safe', 'Nuclear power is green, does not emit greenhouse gases', 'Nuclear power is used on Navy ships which have sailed around the world for 60 years without an accident', 'And of course we ought to be investing in alternate energy sources', 'Recently there was a group of retired military officers who said that climate change and energy independence is a national security issue', 'It is', \"We've got to reduce our dependence on imported oil\", 'We can do it through a wide variety of alternative fuels', \"But we have to be serious about it and we're going to have to go to places where we have never gone before\", 'And nuclear power is one of the major issues, but also all kinds of ethanol as well', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator', 'Let me bring Congressman Paul back into this conversation', 'In 2005, President Bush signed an energy bill that provided billions of dollars in tax break subsidies to the oil companies, with the goal of boosting domestic production', 'At a time of these record profits, do you believe these companies need a helping hand from the federal government', \"PAUL: I don't think the profits is the issue\", \"The profits are OK if they're legitimately earned in a free market\", 'What I object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them R&D money', \"I don't think that should be that way\", 'They should take it out of the funds that they earn', \"But also, you can't discuss energy without discussing our foreign policy\", 'Why do we go to the Middle East', \"We know the oil is very important about the Middle East and why we're there\", 'Why did we, our government, help overthrow Mosaddeq in 1953', 'It had to do with oil', 'So, our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests', \"The profits, that's not the problem\", \"It's the problem that we succumb to the temptation to protect oil interests by literally going out and fighting wars over oil\", 'BLITZER: Governor Gilmore, you agree', \"GILMORE: I agree that if you make profits of the open marketplace, that that's an appropriate thing to do\", 'I also believe that they should be going in and putting this additional money into additional drilling, into additional exploration', \"But it's going to have to be bigger than that\", \"We're going to have to in fact look to all sources: ethanol, biomass, coal, clean coal, the opportunities for natural gas, and nuclear power\", 'And by the way, nuclear power will help this whole issue of global warming', 'And one more point in direct answer to your question: The Kyoto treaty was, in fact, fatally flawed', 'That was a treaty that in fact was going to basically just transfer our money directly to Russia for nothing, because they were going to get credits because simply that their economy had declined', \"The truth is, we're going to have to get a program in place, an international diplomatic answer, that is going to include every nation of the world in this entire project\", 'And that includes China and India', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', 'Let me bring Scott back for the next question', 'SPRADLING: Congressman Paul, a question for you', 'Most of our closest allies, including Great Britain and Israel, allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military', \"Is it time to end don't ask/don't tell policy and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the U\", 'S', 'military', 'PAUL: I think the current policy is a decent policy', 'And the problem that we have with dealing with this subject is we see people as groups, as they belong to certain groups and that they derive their rights as belonging to groups', \"We don't get our rights because we're gays or women or minorities\", 'We get our rights from our creator as individuals', 'So every individual should be treated the same way', 'So if there is homosexual behavior in the military that is disruptive, it should be dealt with', \"But if there's heterosexual sexual behavior that is disruptive, it should be dealt with\", \"So it isn't the issue of homosexuality\", \"It's the concept and the understanding of individual rights\", 'If we understood that, we would not be dealing with this very important problem', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Governor Huckabee, I want you to weigh in as well', \"Do you believe it's time to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the United States military\", \"HUCKABEE: Wolf, I think it's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct\", \"I think that's what Congressman Paul was saying: It's about conduct; it's not about attitude\", \"But I'd like to ask you\", 'You said a moment ago that you were going to all give us a chance to deal with the issue of immigration', \"BLITZER: We're going to come back to that\", \"HUCKABEE: And I hope you'll do that\", 'BLITZER: We will', \"We'll come back to immigration\", 'HUCKABEE: You held us to it, and now I want to hold you to it, so', \"BLITZER: We're going to come back\", 'HUCKABEE:', 'if you could give us that opportunity', \"BLITZER: We're going to come back to immigration\", \"But right now, we're talking about allowing gays to serve openly in the military\", \"But you're opposed to that\", \"HUCKABEE: I just said I think it's a matter -- it's not -- you don't punish people for their attitudes; you punish them if their behavior creates a problem\", \"And it's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct\", \"BLITZER: So you wouldn't change existing policy\", 'HUCKABEE: What', \"BLITZER: You wouldn't change existing policy\", \"HUCKABEE: I don't think that I would\", \"I think it's already covered by the existing policy that we do have, in fact\", \"BLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, recently we've learned that several talented trained linguists -- Arabic speakers, Farsi speakers, Urdu speakers -- trained by the U\", 'S', 'government to learn those languages to help us in the war on terrorism, were dismissed from the military because they announced they were gays or lesbians', 'Is that, in your mind, appropriate', 'GIULIANI: This is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this', 'Back in 1994 we went through this', 'And it created a tremendous amount of disruption', 'Colin Powell, I think, was still the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before he left at the beginning of the Clinton administration', 'He came to the view that this was a good policy', \"And I think in time of war, in a time where we're trying to deal with this transition to a new kind of warfare that we have to be fighting -- and we haven't gotten all the way there yet\", 'We need a hybrid army, we need to look at nation-building as part of what we have to teach our military', \"I don't think this would be the right time to raise these issues\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'GIULIANI: And I think we should rely on the judgment of our commanders in a situation like this', \"They know what's disruptive and what's not\", \"And at a time of war, you don't make fundamental changes like this\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor', \"Governor Romney, the mayor referred to the don't ask/don't tell policy, which was implemented during the Clinton administration, after Bill Clinton became president\", \"In 1994, you were quoted as saying that you advocated gays being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation's military\", 'The question to you is, do you still feel that way', \"ROMNEY: No, actually when I first heard of the don't ask/don't tell policy I thought it sounded awfully silly and didn't think that'd be very effective, and I turned out to be wrong\", \"It's been the policy now in the military for, what, 10, 15 years\", 'And it seems to be working', 'And I agree with what Mayor Giuliani said, that this is not the time to put in place a major change, a social experiment, in the middle of a war going on', \"I wouldn't change it at this point\", 'We can look at it down the road', 'But it does seem to me that we have much bigger issues as a nation that we ought to be talking about than that policy right now', \"BLITZER: Senator McCain, you've been involved in military matters virtually your whole life\", 'What do you say', 'MCCAIN: We have the best-trained, most professional, best- equipped, most efficient, most wonderful military in the history of this country', \"And I'm proud of every one of them\", '(APPLAUSE)', \"There just aren't enough of them\", 'So I have to rely on our military leadership, in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young Americans in combat as we speak', 'So I think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue', 'It is working, my friends', 'The policy is working', \"And I am convinced that that's the way we can maintain this greatest military\", 'As much as I revere the greatest generation, as much as I love my own generation, this is the very best', \"Let's not tamper with them\", 'BLITZER: Is there anyone here who believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the United States military', 'If you do, speak up now', 'Scott, go ahead with your question', 'SPRADLING: Gentlemen, last night, we asked Democrats, if they were elected, what role would they use former President Clinton', \"I'm not going to ask you that\", '(LAUGHTER)', \"But, Governor Thompson, I'd like to know, seeing as how you were a member of President Bush's Cabinet as health and human services secretary, how would you use George W\", 'Bush in your administration', 'THOMPSON: I certainly would not send him to the United Nations', '(LAUGHTER)', 'I believe George W', 'Bush has tremendous characteristics', \"He's very honest\", \"He's very straightforward\", 'I would put him out on a lecture series, talking to the youth of America about honesty, integrity, perseverance, passion, and serving the public', 'George W', 'Bush believes very much in public service, as does his father, as does his brothers, as does his mother', 'I think he could be a wonderful spokesperson, making sure that young people realize that public service is a very noble cause and something that young people should aspire to, like all the young people here on this campus should also have the opportunity to serve in public life', '(APPLAUSE)', \"BLITZER: Senator Brownback, same question to you: If you're elected president, what would you ask your predecessor to do\", 'BROWNBACK: Well, I would talk with him about it first, and I would ask him about it', 'I think he would probably take a position the way his dad did, saying, \"You know, I think you need to have your time in the limelight', 'And I will be willing to help out if you have a tragedy overseas', '\"', 'His father has been excellent, in the tsunami that hit Sri Lanka and other places, in helping fund-raising', \"He's been a wonderful ambassador in those sorts of situations\", \"And frankly, I think that's the right role for an ex-president\", \"And I really think, in many respects, President Clinton has not assumed the right role of an ex-president, where he's injected himself a lot more on policy issues that haven't been appropriate, and he really should defer more to the person that's in the job\", \"There's one person that's president at a time, and that's the way it should be\", 'BLITZER: Congressman Tancredo, I see you anxious to weigh in', 'TANCREDO: Thank you', 'Some time ago, in 2003 I think it was, that I got a call from Karl Rove, who told me that, because of my criticism of the president, I should never darken the doorstep of the White House', \"I have been so disappointed in the president in so many ways since his -- actually for the last several years, not just the immigration issue, but several other things, including the No Child Left Behind and the massive increase in government that we call prescription drug -- Medicare prescription drug, that I'm afraid I would have to tell the president of the United States -- I mean, as president, I would have to tell George Bush exactly the same thing Karl Rove told me\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', 'Governor Huckabee', '(APPLAUSE)', 'you served, as you reminded us, a long time as a governor, Republican governor of Arkansas', 'Your old job is now in Democratic hands', 'Here in New Hampshire, the GOP has suffered some significant losses as well', 'And the Republicans lost the majority in the House and the Senate, as you well know', \"Simple question: What's happened to the GOP\", \"HUCKABEE: Lost credibility, because we didn't do what we were hired to do\", \"When you're elected, you're hired to do a job\", \"You're hired to cut spending, lower taxes, bring more government back to the local people\", 'We did the polar opposite', 'And the people fired us', 'And I think, in many ways, though there were some good people that got caught up in the tsunami of the 2006 elections, the Republican Party, as a whole, deserved to get beat', \"We've lost credibility, the way we bungled Katrina, the fact that there was corruption that was unchecked in Washington, and the fact that there was a feeling that there was not a proper handling of the Iraqi war in all of its details, and the indifference to people pouring over our borders\", 'And let me just add this, Wolf', 'There are a lot of people for whom the immigration issue is like a lot of them', 'They see Washington not taking the kind of positions to build a fence, and they know that when they go to the airport to get on an airplane, they have to show photo I', 'D', \", they have to go through layers of security, and they don't understand why someone across an international border doesn't have to do the same thing\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'Thank you, Governor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Congressman Hunter, I want to just -- because he raised the issue -- he raised the issue of corruption', 'Do you think it would be appropriate for President Bush to pardon Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, who was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for his role in the CIA leak case', \"HUNTER: You know, I think, Wolf, to make a determination on that, you'd have to look at the transcript\", \"I'll tell you a couple of transcripts I have looked at, and that's the agents, Compean and Ramos, who were given 11 and 12 years respectively for stopping a drug dealer bringing 750 pounds of drugs across the border\", \"I've looked at their transcript; I would pardon Compean and Ramos right now\", '(APPLAUSE)', \"And let me say, with respect to what Mike said, we've got to bring back the Reagan Democrats to this party, because we need the Reagan Democrats for Republican leadership to work\", \"And we're going to have to get a good trade bill that brings jobs back to this country\", \"We're going to have to stop China from cheating on trade, build the middle class, build jobs, Wolf\", \"That's what strengthens the Republican Party\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: I just want to do a quick \"yes\" or \"no', '\" And I\\'m going to go down the rest of the group and let everybody just tell me \"yes\" or \"no\": Would you pardon Scooter Libby', '(UNKNOWN): No',

appeal process\", \"We've got to see what happens here\", 'GIULIANI: I think the sentence was way out of line', 'I mean, the sentence was grossly excessive in a situation in which, at the beginning, the prosecutor knew who the leak was', 'BLITZER: So, yes or no, would you pardon him', 'GIULIANI:', \"and he knew a crime wasn't committed\", 'I recommended over a thousand pardons to President Reagan when I was associate attorney general', 'I would see if it fit the criteria for pardon', \"I'd wait for the appeal\", 'I think what the judge did today argues more in favor of a pardon because', 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'GIULIANI:', 'this is excessive punishment', 'BLITZER: All right', \"GIULIANI: When you consider -- I've prosecuted 5,000 cases\", \"BLITZER: I'm trying to get a yes or no\", '(LAUGHTER)', 'GIULIANI: Well, this is a very important issue', \"This is a very, very important -- a man's life is at stake\", 'And the reality is, this is an incomprehensible situation', 'They knew who the leak was', 'ROMNEY: Hey, Wolf, can I explain', 'GIULIANI: And ultimately, there was no underlying crime involved', 'BLITZER: All right', 'ROMNEY: This is one of those situations where I go back to my record as governor', \"I didn't pardon anybody as governor, because I didn't want to overturn a jury\", 'But in this case, you have a prosecutor who clearly abused prosecutorial discretion by going after somebody when he already knew that the source of the leak was Richard Armitage', \"He'd been told that\", 'So he went on a political vendetta', 'BLITZER: Was that a yes', \"ROMNEY: It's worth looking at that\", \"I will study it very closely if I'm lucky enough to be president\", \"And I'd keep that option open\", 'BLITZER: Senator', 'BROWNBACK: Yes', \"The basic crime here didn't happen\", 'What they were saying was that the identity of an agent', 'BLITZER: All right', 'Governor', 'BROWNBACK:', 'was revealed, but that agent has to be in the field for that to be a crime', \"That didn't occur\", 'BLITZER: Governor', 'THOMPSON: Bill Clinton committed perjury at a grand jury, lost his law license', 'Scooter Libby got 30 months', \"To me, it's not fair at all\", 'But I would make sure the appeal was done properly, and then I would examine the record', 'BLITZER: Congressman', 'TANCREDO: Yes', 'BLITZER: Yes', 'All right', 'We heard from all of them', '(APPLAUSE)',

minutes', '(BREAK)', \"BLITZER: We're now set for our voters here to ask questions\", \"Our pool of voters here are either registered Republicans or independents, but they're likely -- likely to vote Republican in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary\", 'We brought them together with the help from the New Hampshire Political Library and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics', 'CNN producers have interviewed all of them', 'Working with me in this half of the debate is Jennifer Vaughn from our partner WMUR-TV', 'Jennifer, who has the first question', 'JENNIFER VAUGHN, WMUR-TV: Thank you, Wolf', 'And good evening to you all tonight', 'I have Erin Flanagan with me tonight', 'Hi, Erin', 'QUESTION: Hi, Jennifer', 'VAUGHN: You live in Bedford, New Hampshire', 'QUESTION: I do', 'VAUGHN: You have a question about the war in Iraq, which is something that is deeply personal to you', 'QUESTION: It is', 'Unfortunately, my beloved little brother, 1st Lieutenant Michael Joseph Cleary, was killed in action in Taji, Iraq, eight days before he was to return home on December 20th of 2005', 'He was the best of the best and answered the call to serve our country', 'My family has been devastated by the loss', 'As a member of an American family who has suffered so greatly at the choices made by the current administration, I desperately would like to know what you as commander in chief would do, both in the halls of the American government, to bring the parties together, as well as on the desert sands of the Middle East to bring this conflict to a point in which we can safely bring our troops home', 'VAUGHN: Erin, thank you', \"Congressman Hunter, let's begin with you on that\", 'HUNTER: OK', 'Absolutely', 'The key to leaving -- and, incidentally, thank you for his service', 'And I want to let you know, my son', '(APPLAUSE)', 'I want to let you know that my son Duncan, the day after 9/11, joined the Marine Corps, quit his job, did two tours in Iraq', \"He's in Afghanistan right now\", \"First, I want you to know that it's worth it\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'What he did was worth it', 'And if we can achieve a country in Iraq that will not be an state sponsor of terrorism for the next 5 to 10 to 20 years, that will be a friend, not an enemy, of the United States, and will have a modicum of freedom, that is in the national interest of the United States, just like establishing a free Japan on the other side of the Pacific was in our interest after World War II, just like providing freedom and a protective shield for Salvador in Central America was in our interest', 'So what I would do, and what we need to do right now, and we are doing, is standing up the Iraqi army', \"There is 129 battalions of Iraqis that we've trained and equipped\", 'We need to start moving them into the combat zones where they displace the heavy American combat forces', 'Then we can pull our forces out', 'We can bring them home or send them wherever Uncle Sam needs them again', 'BLITZER: Thank you', \"HUNTER: That's how we leave Iraq the right way\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', \"Senator Brownback, I'd like you to weigh in\", 'BROWNBACK: If I could', \"And thank you for your family's service and what your brother did\", \"That's incredible and an incredible gift that he and your family have given us\", \"And I think you've identified the right thing\", \"It's not about leaving, and it's not about being defeated\", \"It's about getting the situation to a point that we can turn it over to Iraqis, and then us pull back from the front of the line\", \"That's why I'm putting forward tomorrow a bill, and this would be about a three-state solution in Iraq -- a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shia state -- with Baghdad as the federal city, in a loose, weak, federated system; oil revenues equally divided\", \"And it's a bipartisan bill\", 'We will have bipartisan support', \"We've got to pull together here to win over there\", 'BLITZER: Senator', \"BROWNBACK: And we can do this together, but we haven't put yet forward, this administration, a political solution that will be long- term and durable\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'Thank you, Senator', \"BROWNBACK: That's what we've got to do\", 'BLITZER: Senator McCain, is that a good idea, to divide up Iraq into three separate', \"BROWNBACK: It's not divided\", \"It's three states, one country\", \"MCCAIN: It's not -- ma'am, I want to tell you thank you for your brother's service and sacrifice to our country\", \"We are proud of you and your endurance, and we're proud of your sacrifice\", \"This war -- I'm going to give you a little straight talk\", 'This war was very badly mismanaged for a long time', 'And Americans have made great sacrifices, some of which were unnecessary because of this management of the war -- mismanagement of this conflict', 'I believe we have a fine general', 'I believe we have a strategy which can succeed, so that the sacrifice of your brother would not be in vain, that a whole 20 million or 30 million people would have a chance to live a free life in an open society, and practice their religion, no matter what those differences are', 'And I believe that if we fail, it will become a center of terrorism, and we will ask more young Americans to sacrifice, as your brother did', 'This is long and hard and tough', 'But I think we can succeed', 'And God bless you', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator', 'Jennifer, go ahead with your next question', 'VAUGHN: Cynthia Kiernan is here with us tonight', 'Cynthia, you live in Merrimack, New Hampshire', 'QUESTION: Yes', 'VAUGHN: You can go ahead and stand up', 'And you brought your husband with you', 'QUESTION: Yes', 'Michael served in Iraq', 'And we have a question regarding the government in Iraq', 'Everyone\\'s talking about, \"Pull our troops out; pull our troops out', '\" Well, considering they\\'ve lived under a dictatorship for the last 30 years or so, what are we going to do to make sure they have a government in place before we do pull our troops out and they\\'re able to help themselves', \"Otherwise, we're just putting them in a position to accept another terrorist leader\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'VAUGHN: Congressman Paul', \"PAUL: Well, we've had four years to do this and it hasn't worked\", 'The biggest incentive for them to take upon themselves the responsibility is just for us to leave', \"PAUL: We don't need to lose 100 men and women every month, more than a thousand per year\", \"And so, if you want it done, you want them to take over, you've got to give them an incentive\", 'So I think we should immediately stop patrolling the streets', \"That's a policeman's job\", \"It's not the work of the Army\", \"We're not fighting a military battle\", \"We're in a different type of warfare right now\", 'So the sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can make sure that no more Americans will die', 'We have a lot of goodness in this country', 'And we should promote it, but never through the barrel of a gun', 'We should do it by setting good standards, motivating people and have them want to emulate us', \"But you can't enforce our goodness, like the necons preach, with an armed force\", \"It doesn't work\", 'Woodrow Wilson was telling us about that, in promoting democracy a long time ago', 'BLITZER: Thank you', \"PAUL: It doesn't work and we have to admit it\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Let me bring Mayor Giuliani in', \"I don't know if you consider yourself a neocon, but go ahead and respond to what Congressman Paul said\", '(LAUGHTER)', 'GIULIANI: Michael, thank you very much for serving us, and thank your family for their tremendous sacrifice', \"I'd like to put it in a slightly different context\", \"I believe that your service for us and your brother's sacrifice is one of the reasons we're safe now in the United States\", 'I believe that this terrorist war began way back in the 1970s', 'They attacked us in 1993 in New York', 'They attacked us again in 2001 in a horrible way', \"And I believe that what we're doing in Iraq, if we can get it right, is going to help reduce the risk for this country\", 'And if we get it wrong, this is going to be much, much worse for us', \"And part of what we have to do and we haven't done right is take on that responsibility of nation-building\", 'We created that responsibility for ourselves when we overthrew Saddam Hussein, which we did very effectively', 'It was one of the greatest military actions in American history, overthrowing Saddam Hussein', \"But we didn't accomplish the second step\", 'People can only embrace democracy when they have an orderly existence', 'And we have to help provide that', \"We didn't want that role, but it is our role\", 'And we have to train our military to do it', 'We should probably have an IraqStat program, in which we measure how many people are going to school, how many factories are open, how many people are going back to work', 'We had to get into the nitty-gritty of putting an orderly society together in Iraq', 'It is not too late to do it', \"And I'd just like to ask, I'd just like to ask one question I didn't get to ask before, when you said, if General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things aren't going well, what are we going to do\", 'But suppose General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things are going pretty well', 'Are we going to report that with the same amount of attention that we would report the negative news', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Jennifer, go ahead', 'VAUGHN: Kysa Crusco is here with us tonight', 'Hi, Kysa', 'QUESTION: Hi', 'VAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire', 'You are an attorney', 'QUESTION: I am', 'VAUGHN: OK', \"What's your question tonight\", 'QUESTION: My question is whether you believe that a conservative platform can also include a conservationist agenda', 'And, if so, how', 'VAUGHN: Governor Gilmore', 'GILMORE: The question was whether or not a conservative agenda can also have a conservation agenda', 'And I think that it can', 'Certainly, when I was governor of the state of Virginia, we worked very hard in order to make Virginia a beautiful place and a place where we could in fact be welcoming to people, and that it would be a nice community for people to visit', 'But at the end of the day, this is going to come down to the question of whether or not conservatism can match up with energy independence, which is a national security issue and it is a fundamental part of conservatism', 'Conservatism means empowering people', 'It means cutting taxes and controlling government spending', 'It also means national security', 'And national security means a lot of different elements right at this time', \"And we're discussing some of them tonight\", 'And I can assure the people who are families here tonight, their young people, young men and women who are on the battle lines, and people who are committing their lives, they are in fact serving the national interests of this country in a time of major crisis', 'The other two issues, however, would also go to the issue of the immigration issue, which I want to come back to at some point, but also energy independence', 'And energy independence also can serve the interests of conservation', 'BLITZER: All right', 'GILMORE:', 'particularly if we use nuclear power and other clean forms of energy so that we can in fact make this a clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation', 'BLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor', 'Congressman Tancredo, do you believe true conservatives should be doing more to protect the environment', 'TANCREDO: Yes', \"I think that that's absolutely imperative, and I think so because, frankly, you've got a conservative model to pick from\", 'I mean, you know, Teddy Roosevelt, after all, put this stamp on that -- the whole issue of conserving the environment, creating the national parks system', \"There's nothing anti-conservative about doing anything like that\", 'And you know what else you can do in order to foster that', 'You do it through conservative principles', 'You make it profitable for people to do exactly that, to put -- to make conservation an issue that hits people in the pocketbook, or they can profit by getting involved in conservation', \"That's one way the free market really works perfectly\", \"We've seen it happen all over the world\", 'We can see and we will put conservation to work -- conservation practices to work in the United States through conservative principles', 'We have a lock on that', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', 'Jennifer, go ahead', 'VAUGHN: Good evening, sir', 'You are Doug Hall', 'QUESTION: Yes', \"VAUGHN: I understand that you're the town moderator for Chichester, New Hampshire\", 'QUESTION: I am', \"VAUGHN: What's your question tonight\", 'QUESTION: I know a business owner in northern New Hampshire who was on vacation in Spain last year for about three weeks', 'While he was there, he had to buy refills for prescription drugs, brand name drugs, and he discovered in buying those drugs that he could buy his refills there for $600 less than he could buy them here in New Hampshire', 'So since then, he said he is going to take a trip over to Spain and get his vacation paid for to buy his drugs', 'My question to you is, why is this', 'And if you are elected president, is there anything you would do to address it', 'VAUGHN: Mayor Giuliani', 'GIULIANI: What I would do is change the whole model that we have for health insurance in this country', \"The problem with our health insurance is, it's government and employer-dominated\", \"People don't make individual choices\", \"It's your health\", 'You should own your health insurance', 'We should be giving you a major tax deduction, $15,000 for a family, so you can buy your own health insurance', \"If you buy health insurance for $8,000 or $9,000, you'll save $5,000 or $6,000 in tax- free money\", 'Then we should have a health savings account, in which you can put some money aside to pay for your ordinary medical expenses', 'Health insurance should become like homeowners insurance or like car insurance', \"You don't cover everything on your homeowners policy\", \"If you have a slight accident in your house, if you need to refill your oil with your car, you don't cover that with insurance\", \"But that is covered in many of the insurance policies, because they're government-dominated and they're employer-dominated\", 'What the Democrats suggested on this stage two nights ago was socialized medicine', 'There was a man in California who said to me, \"When we make health insurance free, just wait and see how expensive it will become', '\"', 'And the reality is that we need a free market', 'We need 100 million Americans making different decisions', 'It will bring down the cost of health insurance', 'It will bring down the cost of prescription medicines', 'Free-market principles are the only things that reduce costs and improve quality', 'Socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the United States', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Congressman Hunter, you live on the border, San Diego, not far from Mexico', 'A lot of Americans go to Mexico to buy cheaper prescription drugs', 'A lot of Americans in this part of the country go to Canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs', 'What should we here in the United States be doing to bring down the price of prescription drugs', 'HUNTER: And, Wolf, the fabulous Grampy, my father-in-law, who lives with us, is one of those people that trots down and goes through the border at Yuma and does that', 'So lots of Americans do that', \"But here's what happens\", \"Eighty percent of the new drugs and new inventions that save our lives, that help preserve the lives of the relatives of everyone who's in this particular room right now, 80 percent of those inventions are made in the United States because we have free enterprise, where people can go out, invest\", \"And maybe they drill three dry holes in trying to produce a good drug that will save somebody's lives\", 'Then maybe they hit the jackpot and they produce something that will save people and help their health', 'They then recover their money in the United States', 'And what they have left over, in terms of market, they put into the Third World', 'But Third World countries like Mexico could never provide the amount of money that it takes to make those inventions', 'Otherwise, they would', \"Here's what we have to do: We need to be able to buy our health care insurance across state lines, Wolf\", 'Right now the same single policy that can be purchased in Long Beach for $73 costs $334 in New Jersey', 'The states lock up the insurance industry', \"They won't let Americans buy across state lines, just like they do everything else\", \"If we're able to do that\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'HUNTER:', \"we're going to bring down the cost of health insurance\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', \"Jennifer, let's go back to another question\", 'VAUGHN: Also on the topic of health care tonight, this is a question from our wmur', 'gather', 'com blogger, who is Joshua Williamson', 'Joshua asks, \"Millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the current state of our health-care system, and U', 'S', 'employers are at a disadvantage due to the high cost of health insurance', 'What would you do to fix the health-care system', 'And would you support implementing a single-payer system, in which the government acts as the insurer in order to save enough money to cover the millions of uninsured and to lower premiums for the rest of the U', 'S', 'population', '\"', \"Governor Thompson, let's have you weigh in on that\", \"THOMPSON: You know, I've been here for two debates\", 'We never had one question on health care', 'Thank that person for talking about health care', 'Number one, we spend $2 trillion on health care', \"That's 16 percent of the gross national product\", 'Ninety-three percent of the cost of health care goes into waiting until after you become sick', 'Only 7 percent of the money is used to keep you well in the first place', 'We got to completely transform the health care system, make it a wellness system and make it a prevention system', 'Secondly, we have 125 million Americans that have one or more chronic illnesses', 'In order to change this, we have to educate the American people about tobacco, about diabetes, about cardiovascular and about obesity', \"You do that, you'll be able to change health care\", 'The third thing, 25 percent of Americans use two-thirds of the cost of health care', 'If you manage those diseases, you can reduce that down to 50 percent and save lots of money', 'Fourth, information technology, electronic medical record, a patient bill of rights and be able to have e-prescribing', \"And if you do that, you're going to be able to save billions of dollars\", 'If you just go paperless, ladies and gentlemen, you will save 10 percent of the cost of health care', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor, very much', 'Governor Romney, you worked with the Democrats in the state legislature in your home state, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts', 'You worked with Ted Kennedy to come up with a program that provides some -- mandates, in effect, the individual health insurance coverage', \"Some conservatives say this is simply big government, more liberal involvement in people's lives\", 'What do you say to those conservatives who are critical of the way you handled this issue in Massachusetts', 'ROMNEY: Well, I want to talk to the people, not just to those conservatives who are critical', \"And the people of this country recognize they've got some real concerns in health care\", 'And I learned after I was governor a short bit of time -- I talked to people and they say, \"If I lose my job, I\\'m going to lose my insurance', 'And my insurance premiums are getting higher and higher and higher', '\"', 'And I talked to small-business people, and they said, \"I can\\'t afford the policies anymore', '\"', 'And we said, \"You know, we\\'ve got to find a way to get everybody insured', 'And the last thing we want is to have the government take over health care, because anything they take over gets worse, not better', '\"We\\'re going to turn to Washington, because Washington makes a mess', 'Washington is all talk', 'And we said, \"We need to find a way to get everybody in our state insured with private insurance', '\"', 'The half a million who didn\\'t have insurance, all the people worried that if they lost their job, they\\'d lose insurance, we said, \"We\\'ve got to find a way to get them insured without raising taxes, without a government takeover', '\"', \"And that's what we did\", 'It relies on personal responsibility', 'This is a big issue for this country', 'Every Democrat up there is talking about a form of socialized medicine, government takeover, massive tax increase', 'We have to stand up and not just talk about it', \"I'm the guy who actually tackled this issue\", 'We get all of our citizens insured', 'We get people that were uninsured with private health insurance', 'We have to stand up and say, \"The market works', 'Personal responsibility works', '\"', \"We're going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford, that's theirs, that's portable\", 'They never have to worry about losing it', \"That's the answer\", 'Thank you', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Jennifer, go ahead', 'VAUGHN: Thank you, Wolf', 'Next question comes from you, sir', 'Your name is Max Latona', 'QUESTION: Yes, it is', 'VAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire', 'What do you do for a living, sir', 'QUESTION: I teach philosophy here at Saint Anselm College', \"VAUGHN: And what's your question tonight\", 'QUESTION: My question is a simple one: In your opinion, what is the most pressing moral issue facing this country today', \"And, if you're elected president, how would you address that issue\", 'VAUGHN: Governor Huckabee, you are an ordained minister', 'What is the most pressing moral issue in this country', \"HUCKABEE: Well, it looks like I'm getting all the moral questions tonight, and I guess that's a good thing\", '(LAUGHTER)', \"That's better than getting the immoral questions\", \"So I'm happy to get those\", '(LAUGHTER)', 'HUCKABEE: I really believe that, if you define it a moral issue, it is our respect, our sanctity and our understanding of the value of every single human life', 'Because that is what makes America a unique place on this planet: We value every life of an individual as if it represents the life of us all', 'Many of us who are pro-life, quite frankly, I think, have made the mistake of giving people the impression that pro-life means we care intensely about people as long as that child is in the womb', \"But beyond the gestation period, we've not demonstrated as demonstrably as we should that we respect life at all levels, not just during pregnancy\", \"We shouldn't allow a child to live under a bridge or in the backseat of a car\", \"We shouldn't be satisfied that elderly people are being abused and neglected in nursing homes\", 'It should never be acceptable to us that people are treated as expendable -- any people', 'But the unique part of our country is that we elevate and we celebrate human life', 'And if you look at us with a contrast to the Islamic jihadists, who would strap a bomb to the belly of their own child, march him into a crowded room, set the detonator and kill innocent people, they celebrate death; we celebrate life', \"It's the fundamental thing that makes us unique, and it keeps us free\", 'I pray we never, ever abandon that basic principle', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, what is the most pressing moral issue in America today', 'GIULIANI: I think the governor is correct', 'I would put it in maybe a slightly different way', 'We have great gifts in this country that come to us from God', 'We have a country in which we have freedom of religion, freedom of press, freedom for the individual, the right to elect our own officials', \"And the reality is that in some of the world, much of the world, that doesn't exist\", 'And I think the challenge for our generation is going to be, are we able to share those gifts in an appropriate way with the rest of the world', 'If we can bring along the Middle East, if we can bring along those countries that are presently our enemies, and get them to see the values of these ideals, if we have the moral strength to be able to explain it to them in the way Ronald Reagan was able to do with communism, then we can end up having the peace that we want', 'And we should not -- we should never become pessimistic about this', 'Remember, this is the country that was at war with Vietnam just a short while ago', \"We're friends now\", 'BLITZER: All right', 'GIULIANI: This was a country that was at war with Japan, Italy and Germany a generation ago', \"They're some of our best friends today\", 'We have great resources in this country', \"And watching the strength of America when we believe in the essential ideals that we have -- they're not just American ideals; they come from God\", \"And I think it's our moral obligation to find the right way to share that with the rest of the world\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Congressman Paul, what is the most pressing moral issue in the United States right now', 'PAUL: I think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote preemptive war', \"I do not believe that's part of the American tradition\", 'We, in the past, have always declared war in defense of our liberties or go to aid somebody', 'But now we have accepted the principle of preemptive war', 'We have rejected the just war theory of Christianity', \"And now, tonight, we hear that we're not even willing to remove from the table a preemptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security\", 'I mean, we have to come to our senses about this issue of war and preemption and go back to traditions and our Constitution and defend our liberties and defend our rights, but not to think that we can change the world by force of arms and to start wars', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', 'Senator Brownback really wants to weigh in, as well', 'BROWNBACK: Thank you', 'And thank you for the question from a philosopher', \"I think it's the life issue clearly, and I'm pro-life and I'm whole life\", \"And one of the things I'm the most -- the proudest about our party about is that we've stood for life\", \"We've been a party that has stood for a culture of life\", 'And it was in our platform in 1980, and it continues today', \"And with that respect -- and I have respect for my other colleagues -- that's why I don't think we can nominate somebody that's not pro-life in this party, because it is at our core\", 'We believe that every life is beautiful, is sacred, is a child of a loving God from natural -- from conception to natural death', \"And that applies not only here and in the womb, it applies to somebody that's in poverty, it applies to the child in Darfur\", 'And that philosophy, being pro-life and whole life, is something I think can really help move us forward as a country and as a party', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Senator, if Rudy Giuliani got the Republican presidential nomination, would you be able to support him', 'BROWNBACK: That question came up at the first debate, and I stated that this is something that we as a party have struggled with', 'I have great respect for the mayor', \"I don't think we're going to nominate somebody that's not pro-life\", 'BLITZER: Would you be able to support him', 'BROWNBACK: I can support and will support the nominee of our party', 'But our party has stood on principles', \"It's a party of principles\", \"It's not a party of personalities\", 'We lose when we walk away from our principles', \"That's when we have trouble\", \"And that's the country wants us to do\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator', 'BROWNBACK:', 'is to stand for principles', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Jennifer, go ahead', 'VAUGHN: Next question tonight from Neil Capano', 'Neil, you are an airline agent', 'QUESTION: Yes, I am', 'VAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire', 'You have a question tonight for Governor Romney', 'QUESTION: Yes, I do', 'First of all, I would like to thank all of you for joining us tonight in beautiful Manchester, New Hampshire', 'However, my question is for Governor Romney exclusively', \"You've been accused of -- you've been accused of flip-flopping on immigration\", 'Just earlier tonight you indicated']\n",

threat to himself and to others\", 'He went to a gun store, he got a gun, passed a background check', 'And, yet was able to go out and shoot Gabby and 18 other people', \"And, the NRA says the problem

go to a gun show, or on the Internet to buy a gun\", 'And we need to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from doing that', \"It's crazy that we have a system -- you know, we have a system that responsible gun owners get a background check, and the option to avoid one is available for anybody who doesn't want to do it\", \"I mean, it's a -- it's a crazy system\", \"WALLACE: But doesn't the

waste of time\", 'KELLY: They absolutely have a point', 'I mean, they are -- they are right on that issue', 'I mean, we need to encourage states to include the mental health records', 'After Virginia Tech, for instance, Virginia was one of the worst states on this', \"And after what happened in Virginia Tech, they're actually really, really good about getting those records to the federal government\", \"So I'm encouraging -- I mean, I would love to be able to work with the leadership of the NRA and work with the United States Senate and the House to make sure we get those records in the system and then close the gun show and private seller loophole, like 92 percent of Americans want, like 74 percent of NRA members want\", 'WALLACE: The big hold-up in the Senate now over the background check is that if you do expand it to include gun shows and private sales, do the people who sell the guns in those cases have to keep private records', 'Keep records of those sales', \"And as you well know, the NRA says the danger is that if they have to do what licensed dealers have to do and keep those records, that could be used to form a national registry and somewhere down the line, that could be used to confiscate people's guns\", 'How do you respond to that', \"KELLY: Well, I just don't think it's logical\", 'I mean, right now, when you buy a gun in a gun store like I did, you know, there is a record that remains with the gun store', \"It's not a record with the federal government\", 'It is not a record that is going to one day lead to a national registry, or gun confiscation', 'So the system currently works with the federally licensed firearms dealers', 'There is no reason that same system cannot work with the gun show, and the private seller', 'But, of course, this is an issue for many, you know, some Republican senators', \"And it's certainly something that could be worked on\", \"I mean, we've got a lot of smart members in the Senate and I think they can figure out a compromise on this issue\", 'WALLACE: Finally, Arizona officials this week released a lot of records about the shooter, Jared Loughner, the man who shot Gabby and 18 others', 'His parents, it turns out, knew he was deeply disturbed', 'They tested him for drugs, but they did not send him to get help', \"What do you have to say after learning all of this to Jared Loughner's parents\", 'KELLY: Well, certainly as a parent, myself, I understand', 'I mean, it is a tragic thing they went through as well', 'It would have been an entirely different situation, however, if he would have gotten some mental health -- you know, gotten an evaluation', \"And when he -- you know, certainly in his case, when he's taking medication, he's not as psychotic as without the medication\", 'So, this would have clearly been -- would not have happened if he would have had proper mental health treatment, you know', \"But you can't -- you know, you can't go back in time\", \"I mean, there's -- you know, the only thing we can do is move forward and try to make sure that the dangerously mentally ill are not only getting treatment for their mental illness, but let's make sure they don't have access to guns\", \"Let's make sure criminals don't have access to guns\", 'I mean, our organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions -- I mean, we are really focused on this, every, single day', 'To make sure we fix this problem, and we address gun violence in this country', 'WALLACE: I just want to pick up on that last point, because after Newtown, there was a lot of talk about making it easier for authorities, a school or a family to commit a Jared Loughner, an Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter before they got access to guns and acted out in this horrible way', 'But, that seems to have been forgotten in all of the debate about gun control', \"KELLY: Well, I don't know if it has been forgotten\", 'I mean, certainly, you know, the debate in the Senate is going to -- going to include some aspect of help for the mentally ill', \"Now, what that is, you know, I'm not -- you know, I don't know what those details -- how that's going to turn out but that is certainly an important component of this\", \"I mean, to address mental illness in this country, to get those records of mental illness into the system and then to make sure that there isn't a loophole where the clearly dangerously and mentally ill and criminals can get access to a gun\", 'WALLACE: Captain Kelly, we want to thank you', 'Thank you for joining us', 'And we want to wish you and your wife, Gabby,

WUERL, ARCHBISHOP OF WASHINGTON: Thank you', \"It's great to be back\", 'WALLACE: From the moment he took the world stage, Pope Francis talked about serving the poorest, the weakest, the least important', 'On Holy Thursday, he followed the tradition of washing the feet of 12 people', 'But instead of 12 priests as other popes have done, he washed and kissed the feet of a dozen young inmates, including women and Muslims', 'Question -- what message is the pope sending about what he is going to do', 'WUERL: I think his message is a very clear one, that you bear witness with words, but you also bear witness with actions', \"And I think what he is trying to say to all of us is, if we really are trying to introduce people to the gospel, if we are really trying to tell believers how important the gospel is, can't you do that as well, maybe even better, with actions as well as words\", \"I think that's what he's trying to do\", 'WALLACE: There is a widespread sense that the church has problems, governance problems', 'That there is corruption inside the church, that there are turf wars', 'One of the first things the pope has to deal with is that secret investigative report about the Vatican leaks', 'Why did the cardinals believe that Pope Francis was the right man to clean things up', 'WUERL: I think there are probably a couple of ideas that were going around as we were talking about who might be the next pope, who would be the best person to choose', 'One, when we talk about the church, we also want to make sure that we distinguish it from just the operation of the Vatican', 'I think we were concerned about who will keep the momentum of the new evangelization going and who will keep this energy the church is seeing among many of our young people around the world', 'Who will keep that going', 'At the same time, somebody has to address the administration of the Holy See', \"Somebody has to take a look at what is working and what isn't working\", \"I can't tell you what that means, because we didn't have the report\", 'But the very fact that we recognize there needs to be some change, that was a part of the thinking', 'Can you -- can you envision someone better than Pope Francis', 'The credibility he brings to whatever he decides, in the Vatican, is going to be enormous', 'But, in the meantime, he is keeping the focus on the rest of the church, where there is an awful lot of good going on', 'WALLACE: But on the inside game, how aggressive a reformer, how revolutionary, if you will, do you expect Pope Francis to be -- not on doctrine -- but on changing the way the church does business', \"WUERL: Well, perhaps we're seeing signs of it in the fact that he hasn't moved in to the papal residence, that he's chosen to stay in the residence where we all were for the conclave\", \"Maybe he's simply saying, there are going to be a lot of changes, we're going to get back to something that will be a little more direct, and maybe contact with the pope will be a little easier\", 'And that was one of the things that we cardinals talked about -- the need to find ways in which there is a lot more communication between the rest of the church and the pope', 'WALLACE: All right', 'You were there', 'We saw all of the pictures', 'Take us inside', 'This is your first conclave', 'Take us inside the Sistine Chapel', 'They closed the doors, the 115 cardinal electors are all there and you are choosing the head of church, for 1', '2 billion, 1', '3 billion Catholics', 'What is that moment like', \"WUERL: There is a solemnness that I

wearing what we would wear if we were presiding at a mass, somewhere\", 'Not as the celebrant but simply as a cardinal', 'This absolute silence -- and the one thing you are supposed to be doing is listening with your heart', \"Before I went in, I talked to one of the older cardinals, he's 90 years old\", 'He came to one of those general meetings, just so we could chat', 'I have known him for 40 years', 'And I said to him, \"Cardinal, I am feeling a little bit overwhelmed by all of this', '\" He said, \"When you get into the Sistine Chapel and they close that door, just listen with your heart', \"And you'll hear\", '\"', 'And it turned out to be true', 'There is a solemn oath you take, and, then, Chris, when the moment comes to write a name on the ballot', 'There is nobody there but

you, so-and-so, Bergoglio, Pope Francis has so many votes', 'Do you mill about and talk and --', 'WUERL: No', 'This is the interesting thing', 'They count the ballots and that in itself is rather solemn', \"Three people look at each ballot, and go through the whole thing, so -- once it's clear no one was elected, nothing is said\", 'There is this moment, quiet, and then, you just write another name on the next ballot', 'It is as if the Holy Spirit is saying, look, now you know the direction, OK', \"You're going to have to -- you're going to have to whittle this down\", 'This is the power of the part, though, Chris, you have your ballot in your hand and you have to stand there in front of that fresco of the last judgment, and say, \"I call on Christ the Lord, who will come to judge me

that there is a constitutional right, what will you say to gays, who are good Catholics, attend church every week, who say, who believe that God made them that way, and who want to commit to a partner', 'WUERL: We are always welcoming of everyone', 'The Catholic Church welcomes everyone', 'But, the Catholic Church also reminds all of us, there is a moral law', 'There are commandments of God, and we have to do our best to live by them', \"We announce that from the pulpit and, we try to meet people where they are and walk with them in life's journey\", 'The church is probably, with 20 centuries of experience, probably the most understanding of the human condition of any institution', \"But, at the same time it does remind, not only gay people, but heterosexual people, straight

possible', \"A lot depends on how well we're able to communicate, how well we're able in a pastoral situation to look at each person's life and see where we are\", 'WALLACE: So, you would allow him to continue in the church but you would not recognize his marriage', 'WUERL: We do that with people who are married, divorced and remarried', \"We say you are still part of the family, but we can't

Catholic university that has housing for married couples, what are they going to do if it's a same sex couple\", \"How is the church and the -- writ large, not just the church but the whole religious

\"WUERL: Shouldn't there be enough space in a society as pluralistic and free as America is to be able to work all of these things out in a way that everybody can be who they are, and carry on their activities\", \"I'm thinking for example when we talk about changing the definition of marriage\", 'There is going to have to be a lot of adjusting, because the whole world has always understood marriage is the word you use to describe when a man and a woman commit to each other for the rest of their lives, and generate and educate children', 'Once you change that arbitrarily, there is going to be downstream from that, all kinds of questions', \"We're going to have to deal with them one by one as we come to them and that's why the church keeps saying, make room for everyone's faith\",

marriage is between a man and a woman, that somehow you don't belong here, that somehow this is -- this is bigotry or this is hate speech\", \"That's what I worry about\", 'There has to be room enough in the society as large, as free and as pluralistic as America, to make space for all of us', 'WALLACE: Finally, for all of the controversies, this is Easter which has a very joyous meaning', 'What is your message, your Easter message, for our viewers', \"WUERL: The Easter message for every Christian is Christ is risen and that's we say, hallelujah, come to mass\", 'But for the rest of the world,

ratcheting up - he is ratcheting up the tension', 'KRISTOL: Well, the normal explanation is that it helps stabilize and, you know, helps secure his situation at home -- maybe that is true', \"But the

'I mean, Japan, they lobbed a missile over Japan', \"It's dangerous\", 'WALLACE: Yeah, let me pick up on that, Mara', \"Because the North Koreans traditionally, as Bill points out like to bluster and saber- rattle, but even by their standards, this is pretty extreme what is going on now, and that is the concern, that somehow particularly with South Korean, if you've ever been in Seoul, I mean it is an hour's drive from the DMZ\", 'I mean they would be right on the front line', 'The danger is it gets out of hand', 'MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: The danger is it gets out of hand', \"And

understandably, and I think doing anything -- everything we can to reassure them would be helpful, and, obviously, you know, trying to get China to engage in their own region in a way that would be helpful, I think, with Kim Jong-un would be important, too\", \"WALLACE: I'm going to pick up on China in a second\", 'Your thoughts, though, Chuck about the U', 'S', 'response', 'What we have done so far, what more we can do', \"CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think President Obama's approach to North Korea throughout his presidency has been, essentially, not to rise to the bait, and I think that has been a good approach so far\", 'I think sending the B-2s sent a strong signal', 'I think what we are dealing with here is sort of the third generation of a family business over there in North Korea, and the business is building up this whole military structure, building up as Bill suggests, the capability to proliferate', 'Conducting terrorist activities', 'People forget that years ago they blew up a whole group of South Korean diplomats in Burma of all places', 'And the purpose of the family business is through the constant threat, constant belligerence, constant menace, to extract money, concessions, and everything else you can get by blackmailing the other side', 'Whether the endgame of the family business is to actually go to war in South Korea, I doubt, because I think people are -- need to remember, North Korea would not win that war', 'At the very least would come out of it very badly damaged', 'So, I think what we are seeing here is a generation of war hysteria to help control themselves inside and the generation of threats, especially towards this new, more conservative, less concession-minded government in South Korea to see what they can extract', 'As they have now for 20 years since this nuclear issue began', 'WALLACE: You know, one of the concerns here, and that does seem to be different, Bill, is that North Korea seems to be ignoring the warnings from its main, far and away biggest sponsor, China, which had warned the regime and Kim Jong-un not to make these threats against the United States, not to make these threats against South Korea, and yet it proceeded with them', 'Why would Kim risk alienating the country that literally, you know -- talk about biting the hand that feeds you, that literally feeds its people', \"KRISTOL: Well, China never seemed to really have been willing to pull the trigger and stop feeding his people or stop providing other kinds of aid to North Korea, so they've gotten away with this in the past, and the Chinese have been unwilling to risk undermining -- allowing the North Korean regime to be undermined and to fall with the unified Korea\", \"And I think that's dangerous to them\", \"I don't know why, Korea isn't going to invade China, but nonetheless, they want to preserve -- they don't want the East European model of communist regimes falling on their border\", 'The U', 'S', ', what can we do', 'We can get serious about missile defense', 'We spend about 1', '5 percent of our defense budget on missile defense', \"The Obama administration having canceled the ground base interceptors, then restored them just, what, a couple of weeks ago, and said we're going ahead on it\", \"But basically, under both parties, really, but especially under the Democrats, there's been a sort of very haphazard (inaudible) through to President Reagan's announcement 30 years ago\", 'The (inaudible) made a decision, really, and maybe we should try to defend ourselves from nuclear weapons and not just accept them as inevitable', \"And I think in a post-Cold War world, we don't know, the North Korean regime could be ten or 20 years from now, and they could have many more missiles and many more nuclear weapons and they could be proliferating them\", \"I'm not sure we'll find them or the Israelis will know whether they have proliferated\", \"Don't we want to get serious and spend some real money and really invest in serious missile defense for ourselves and our neighbors\", '(CROSSTALK)', 'WALLACE: Ed, the president has kind of flipped on missile defense', 'GILLESPIE: Yeah', 'WALLACE: Because when he first came in, he pulled back on some of the deployment of anti-missile interceptors', 'Now, one of his first steps, he and Chuck Hagel at the Pentagon, was to beef up our interceptors system up along the Alaska coast', 'GILLESPIE: Yeah, and like I said, they should be commended for that', \"I'll take one exception, Bill, I'm not -- I think President Bush did make a priority of missile defense, and one of the first things that the Obama administration did was to reverse that, and now they've reversed themselves again, understanding that there was a reason for it, an important strategic reason for it, and I'm glad they reversed themselves\", \"I wish they hadn't reversed themselves in the first place or reverse the policy in the first place, but we have -- this is an example of why we need missile defense, and we need for our friends to have it as well\", 'WALLACE: All right', \"We have to take a break here, but when we come back, after

in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution, which is newer than cell phones or the Internet', 'I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the ability to see the future', 'SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN: Supposed the states said, because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to

should intervene in the issue of same sex marriage', \"We're back now with the panel\", 'So, at the end of a rare two days of arguments, Bill, where do you think the court is on the constitutional question of same sex marriage, and also, on the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to same sex couples, who have been legally married in their states', 'KRISTOL: I mean, it looks as if the court will strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, on sort of federalism grounds, and', \"WALLACE: But it's a state issue, not a federal issue\", 'KRISTOL: Right, and the federal government in a way is putting a thumb on the scale by preferring traditional marriage to states that -- by preferring states that have chosen traditional marriage over states that have chosen same sex marriage, and it looks as if the court is not going to impose a universal constitutional right to same sex marriage on the nation', \"And I hope they don't, and I -- I think they won't\", \"WALLACE: Do you think that they will leave Prop 8 alone and, just, let's say, deny it on procedural grounds, the plaintiff didn't have standing or do you think that they might decide, yes, Prop 8 either stands or falls in California, but that doesn't impact other states\", \"KRISTOL: Yeah, I can't - I can't tell it, it is hard to read\", 'And maybe others know better than I do what the court is going to do', \"WALLACE: All right, we'll go down the list\", 'Down the row here and see', 'But, one of the points, Mara, that several justices made, is that public opinion is changing so quickly on this issue, both in the polls and, four states in 2012 legalized same sex marriage, that perhaps the court should stay out of it, and leave it to the political process in the states', 'In that sense, could the supporters of same sex marriage be victims of their own success', 'LIASSON: Yes', 'I think they could and I actually think the best outcome for Democrats and even proponents of same sex marriage is if Prop 8 is upheld in California, but there is no sweeping constitutional finding that same sex marriage is legal all over the country, because', 'WALLACE: Well, if Prop 8 is upheld, that means that same sex marriage is banned', \"LIASSON: No, I'm sorry, Prop 8 is -- the lower court ruling is upheld, which means Prop 8 is overturned\", 'WALLACE: OK', \"LIASSON: I'm sorry about that\", 'But if they want to in California, right now they could back and put up Prop 8', \"2, legalizing same sex marriage and it would probably pass, it is a lot more meaningful and profound to kind of adjudicate divisive social issues by voters and legislators, not unelected justices, and I think that it's going to be more lasting political change if you do it at the ballot box\", \"It also means you're not going to have this huge backlash and I agree with Bill, I don't think the court is going in the direction of legalizing same sex marriage on the national constitutional basis\", \"WALLACE: Ed, let's talk about the politics of this\", \"You, of course, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, isn't this a problem for the GOP\", 'As we say, public opinion is moving in the direction of support for same sex marriage, especially among young people, 70, 80 percent of all people of all persuasions, under the age of 35, 40, support same sex marriage as a legal right', 'But the polls show that Republicans still overwhelmingly oppose it, only 27 percent in one poll, I saw, support same sex marriage', 'So, where does the Republican Party go', 'You have an awful lot of your base still very much opposes this', 'But you can see the pendulum swinging for the country', \"GILLESPIE: Chris, I don't see the Republican Party or most Republicans, obviously, changing in terms of believing that marriage is between one man and one woman\", 'I do think that in the context of this debate, as in so many other debates, Republicans have been cast in the negative, you know - in the negative to say we are opposing something as opposed to talking about what most Republicans are for', 'Most Republicans are also for the benefits of marriage in the legal system, that are afforded, the protections like, for example, visitation - hospital visitation rights or survivorship benefits and I think you will hear more Republicans making that point, that we can do those things without having the government sanction same sex marriage', 'WALLACE: But looking at the polls, and, particularly, looking at where younger people are going, would you have any problems in 2016, with a Republican Party platform saying that marriage is between a man and a woman', \"GILLESPIE: I wouldn't have any problem with that\", 'I think one of the questions is, I believe the platform right now calls for a federal constitutional amendment to ban it', 'You know, there may be a debate about that', 'WALLACE: (inaudible) ban same sex marriage', 'GILLESPIE: Yeah, to ban it', \"I don't think you would ever see the Republican Party platform saying we are in favor of same sex marriage, but there may be a question, because I think to Mara's point, the federalism aspect of this Supreme Court debate has been interesting, and because a lot of conservatives have felt for a long time that Roe was wrongfully decided and imposed\", 'WALLACE: Roe v', 'Wade', 'GILLESPIE: Roe v', 'Wade', 'WALLACE: 1973', 'GILLESPIE: And that the issue of abortion should have been left to the states, for people to hash out in a more civil manner', \"A lot of conservatives found themselves arguing in this instance that the court shouldn't impose a federal mandate that it is legal\", 'So there has been a little bit of a shift I think in terms of Republicans saying we should allow this to be worked out in the states not imposed by courts and not imposed federally', 'And, it will be interesting to see how that shakes up, because the platform as it is today says a federal constitutional amendment to ban it', \"WALLACE: We should point out it isn't just conservatives who feel that Roe was wrong in this particular issue, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a justice of the Supreme Court appointed by Democrats, liberal, very much an abortion rights supporter, says she thinks it was a mistake, because she thought it moved the court too quickly in this direction in a judicial fiat instead of leaving it to the states to work out something that they were working out\", 'Chuck, when you listened to what you three learned colleagues, your fellow justices here on the court, say, your thoughts about the debate this week, where it leaves the issue and the political implications', 'LANE: Well, as to the debate, not to sounds Pollyanish, but I thought it was actually refreshing and useful for the whole country to listen to two days of discussion among nine very intelligent people of various views who are not running for office, you know', \"And who aren't obsessed with the short-term political consequences of these things themselves, but are really sort of wrestling with it in a very serious way, and in that regard I think it was a very, very helpful occasion in the whole debate\", \"Because they've had the sort of guts to go through a whole lot of difficult questions, you know, about, is this really just like interracial marriage\", 'What are the social science consequences and so forth', 'But I think what is crystallizing as a result of this is a distinction is developing between the substance of whether this is a good idea or not, and the process of how we as a country are going to decide', 'And, in that respect, I do think there is a -- a kind of a tentative consensus on the court that the procedural - the optimum way to handle it is to let the states decide, to give more time to the democratic process to work this thing out as opposed to having the judicial branch sort of slice through the Gordian knot --', 'WALLACE: But what about the argument', \"For the sake of argument, what about the argument, look, we don't decide constitutional rights\", 'LANE: Right', 'WALLACE:', 'that way', \"We don't decide whether schools can be segregated that way\", \"We don't decide interracial marriage that way\", \"LANE: I think the answer, I've heard from the court was, we're not ready to say this is a constitutional right\", \"That there isn't enough support in the text of the document or in the precedence of this court to say that without same sex marriage every state in the union is violating the Constitution\", 'WALLACE: Thank you, panel', \"See you next week

tie with four states', 'Twenty-one states had better rates; Vermont and Nebraska ranked first with 93 percent rates', 'To our inquiry, Julian Vasquez Heilig, a professor at California State University Sacramento who has been critical of how Texas achieves its reported graduation rates, urged us to put stock in the attrition indicator because, he said, it shows the substantial dropoffs in student enrollment between ninth grade and the end of 12th grade', 'The latest Texas example: In 2010-11, according to the TEA, 390,665 students were in ninth grade', 'Three years later, the agency says, there were 308,851 12th-graders, a 21 percent difference', 'That same year, 2013-14, 303,109 students graduated, the agency says', 'That graduating class, by our calculation, was 78 percent the size of the ninth-grade class three years before', 'By email, Heilig suggested such enrollment drop-offs suggest a soft spot in the calculation of the graduation rates that place Texas among the nation’s best performers', 'He said that’s probably because the rates are rooted in each school district reporting the progress of each student, making it at least possible for administrators to record dropouts as students who left for legitimate reasons — such as moving to another state', 'In May 2014, Heilig laid out his own look at how Texas schools apply student \"leaver\" codes here', 'A TEA spokeswoman expressed confidence in how Texas tracks students', 'Lauren Callahan said by email that if a district’s reported reasons for students leaving school look suspicious, it can trigger a state review', '\"Is some leaver information ultimately inaccurate', '\" Callahan said', '\"Yes, but it is usually not because someone is intentionally lying', 'People just change their minds', 'At the time a student withdrew from public school, the parent signed a document saying the child was being transferred to a private school, for example', 'Ultimately something happens and the child never enrolls anywhere', '\"', 'Our ruling', 'Perry said: \"Texas now has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country', 'And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics', '\"', 'Almost: In 2012-13, per federal statistics, Texas ranked No', '3 in overall graduation rates and No', '1 for its African American and Hispanic rates', 'Then again, comparing graduates to the number of ninth graders enrolled three years earlier, Texas in 2011-12 had an 82 percent \"averaged freshman graduation rate,\" tying with four states and trailing 21 states', 'We

my own experience, in my own country, that the police need a lot of training', 'Many police officers do not recognize the beating of a wife as a crime', 'That is true in my country, that is true throughout our hemisphere and the world', 'So, police officers need training, they need help in understanding that domestic violence is a crime', 'In my country, many judges do not take domestic violence as seriously as violence from a stranger', 'Judges need the training and support to understand that a man beating his wife with a wooden club is committing just as much of a crime as a stranger who would beat a woman on her way home from the market', 'So there is much work to be done to change attitudes and to implant new ideas about what domestic violence truly is', 'But from what

more economically independent, they gained confidence to stand up for their rights in their own families and to play a greater role in their communities', 'For women to live free of violence, they

you rebuild in the aftermath of the hurricane -- but to help you advance a cause of peace and prosperity that you have sacrificed so much and so long to achieve', 'As the world celebrates the 50th

everything you have done to bring your country to this point, as you continue down this road for the fulfillment of that dream -- will make it possible for all of us, throughout our hemisphere and the

of billion dollars more than last year,” that’s compared to ’17 and enacted for exactly that reason', 'We’ve moved a bunch of, like I said, money off of OCO over to the bases primarily in the State Department', 'Keep in mind, the OCO budget had been used for several years as a way to get around the caps', 'Many of us believe, in fact, both Republicans and Democrats believe that it had been abused and misused in order to get around the caps', 'We took advantage of this additional money to go ahead and fix that problem permanently, and we moved money off of OCO into the base', 'Add to that the other $17', '7 billion of budget gimmicks', 'For those of you who are really geeky and you want to talk about CHIMPs, we can talk about that afterwards', 'But for the most part, we plug a lot of the old smoke and mirrors that budgets typically use to try and stay within the caps', 'And the $23', '8 billion is spread about a bunch of different things', 'Q What is that', 'Can you explain the —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: The $23', '8 [billion]', 'Q Yeah', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: It’s a long list, and I think we’re going to — are we going to produce a list of the ’18 add-backs and the detail', 'We only do that on ’19', 'Q Can you give us some highlights of it', 'It’s up there', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Honestly — I honestly don’t have that in front of me, and I apologize', 'But yes, we can get you details about what the $23', '8 [billion] is', 'Q But that’s non-defense', 'Yes', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: This is all non-defense, yeah', 'Q Okay', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: The defense is up here', 'This is all non-defense', 'Keep in mind, this is across every other single part of the government, so they could be small amounts', 'There’s just a lot of them', 'All right, so that’s ’18', 'So, we took the old budget from the springtime, then we added $26 billion for defense, $117 billion for non-defense, and that is what we’ve sent to the Hill and say, “Okay, if you are going to spend all of this money, this is how we would prefer to see you spend it', '” Obviously, the administration’s priorities are infrastructure, opioids, southern border wall — those types of things', 'Not going to be a surprise to anybody', 'If I go to the next slide, I’ll start talking about ’19', 'This is what we were working on up until last week', 'Because that was the cap before the caps deal from last Friday', 'So this is what we’ve been working on for the past half a year or so as we wrote the budget', 'On Friday, they raised the caps to this', 'As we sat down to try and figure out what we would do for ’19, we decided not to spend all of it', 'Again, go back to that message — one of those two topline messages', 'If you’re going to spend it all — you spend it like this, that’s ’18 — but you don’t have to spend it all', 'These are spending caps', 'They are not spending floors', 'And as we sat and looked at the administration’s priorities, we didn’t think it was necessary to spend all the way up to here in order to fund the government and in order to fund our priorities', 'So let’s talk about going from here to here, by going to the next slide, please', 'All right', 'So as you can see, we added some money to — I’ve got some details on', 'I do have some details on this, so give me just a second', 'And I have more paper', 'I have more numbers here, folks, then you can —', 'Q Can you answer a couple of questions about your defense spending', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can try', 'But if we can keep questions to the end, that would be a lot easier', 'Russ, have you got the long list of the additions to the ’19 budget by any chance', 'Yeah, thanks', 'That’s the one', 'So these are the ’19 — we’ll hit some highlights on the ’19 budget', 'You can see it, graphically, here', 'But we plussed up Agriculture — $192 billion', 'Department of the Education went up by $3', '3 [billion] — excuse me, $192 million for Ag — $3', '3 billion for Education', 'The biggest piece of that had to do with the Pell program', 'We’ll talk about that in a second', 'Department of Energy went up by $1', '5 billion', 'This is all off of the budget we were working on before the caps deal was cut', 'The Department of Energy’s Office of Science went up by $1', '2 billion', 'Health and Human Services got the biggest piece', 'Health and Human Services — $15', '8 billion in HHS', 'The biggest chunk of that is NIH', 'You all will remember that I came here last year and I tried to present to you a proposed $9 billion reduction in the NIH grants', 'I think it went from $35 [billion] down to $26 billion', 'We put it back in', 'I learned a really valuable lesson last year', 'Not only did Congress not like our proposed NIH cuts last year, they made them illegal this year', 'Remember last year, I came to you and I said, look, we want to reduce spending on NIH and the way we want to do it is by forcing the programs to look at their administrative costs', 'Because if they could get their administrative costs down to what they actually pay on administrative costs from private grants, we could cut $9 billion in spending and get the exact same amount of research', 'Do you remember that conversation, for those of you who were here', 'I certainly do', 'Congress, when they passed the appropriations bill in April, said not only are we going to plus it back up to the $35-odd billion dollars or whatever it is, but they put a rider in that said it was against the law to spend any money to do analyses on the administrative costs', 'So they prevented us, by law, from trying to save money', 'So I learned my lesson, and we said, “Okay, we got this extra money to spend', '” We put another $9 billion in NIH, which makes up a big piece of the $15', '8 [billion]', 'Another $5 billion there is for opioids', 'We’ll talk about that in a second', 'Health and Human Services went up another $11 billion', 'Another $5 billion there for opioids', 'The opioids money is split between two different pieces of HHS, and health centers get a big chunk of that, too — about $5', '7 billion', 'Homeland up by $1', '5 billion', 'Department of Housing and Urban Development by $2 billion, including another billion for elderly and disabled tenant rent contributions', 'Interior up by $340 million', 'Justice by $12 billion', 'That was mostly a CHIMP, they use a CHIMP in the Crime Victims Fund to sort of push the — do the smoke and mirrors', 'Again, if you care about that, we can talk about that offline', 'Labor up $1', '5 billion', 'State up $1', '5 billion', 'Primarily, it’s State', 'The International Humanitarian Assistance, we’ve plussed up by $1 billion', 'Transportation up by $300 million for (inaudible)', 'Veteran’s Affairs, $2', '4 [billion] — most of it going to the Veterans Choice Program, that was an additional $1', '9 billion', 'EPA up by $724 [million], and NASA by $300 million', 'We talk more about that in detail', 'By the way, this is a good place for me to stop and say, look, I know we’re throwing a bunch of information at you', 'I know that we’re not doing it the same way we did last year, where we’re coming out on day one, and doing this, and coming back the next day, and doing an on-the-record hearing because I have to go on to the Hill tomorrow, do the Senate tomorrow morning, the House after that', 'So I recognize the fact that you won’t get a chance, probably, to get as granular in the questions as you want to', 'But if you could reach out to John Czwartacki after this, we’d make time for you, on an individual basis to go over specific questions on specific line items', 'I do ask — no, and I’m not done yet', 'In fact, I’m not close to being done yet', 'I do ask, before you start writing stuff that say that we’re funding “X” for this year, to please check with us to make sure you’re using the right number', 'Because there are so many numbers floating out there, and I’d hate to have somebody write an article that talks about this but ignores the fact that we just spent a bunch more money on the program that you wrote about there', 'So those are the big additions to ’19', 'Let’s go to slide five, please', 'Talk about some of the macro — oh, these are the highlights we all were talking about', 'Defense goes up — non-defense', 'I’m going to come back to a couple of these in some details in a second', 'Actually, let’s do it now', 'Let’s do it now', 'Let’s talk about some of the things that we’ve got', 'We’ve talked about defense', 'You folks all see — that’s $716 billion for FY19', 'This is the full request that the Department of Defense had', 'By the way, that is what we call the “050 function', '” That is national defense, writ large', 'The actual DOD number is $670 [billion] and something like that, or something like that', 'Because, keep in mind, there are some defense functions that are not in the Defense Department', 'So if you see the allocation to the actual Department of Defense, and it doesn’t equal $716 [billion], that’s because — for example, the Department of Energy handles all the nuclear weapons', 'So a part of that goes there', 'And there’s a couple other programs', 'STAFF MEMBER: $686 [billion]', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: $686 [billion] is the total', 'But when you take all of national defense — what we call the “050 function,” the way they appropriate on the Hill — it is the $716 [billion] that General Mattis talks about', 'And everybody knows that that’s the case', 'So it’s not like we’re hiding the ball on that', 'No, believe me', 'I’m not done yet', 'Drug prices', 'Some really, really good stuff as we go through the President’s priorities for this year', 'Again, we’re funding — we’ve increased funding and we’ve focused on ’19, on the President’s priorities', 'We’ve talked about defense', 'We’ve talked about infrastructure', 'I could talk about that a lot, but I know you folks have already — if you have some questions about that, we can do, but I think you’ve got the details already on infrastructure', 'Drug prices', 'This is probably the stuff you folks are seeing for the first time', 'I was really excited when the President actually put that in the State of the Union Address', 'I was one of the few people — I got a chance to see the full speech', 'And it started off as a fairly long speech and got whittled down and whittled down and whittled down', 'And to see that drug prices made it into that final draft was a big plus, I thought', 'You’re going to see a major commitment by the administration in both additional spending and reforms to get drug prices down this year', 'The FDA is looking at a total increase of over $1 billion', 'That’s almost a 22 percent increase off of ’17 enacted', 'This is one of our primary examples of spending more money on things that work', 'Scott Gottlieb has shown an absolute ability to increase the flow of generics into the market and to save money', 'This administration will save seniors over $300 million this year already because of the work that the FDA has done on generics', 'So you’re going to see a major commitment on us here to increase spending on FDA to try and increase the flow of generics, increase the approval of new drugs, to do exactly what the President talked about during the campaign, which is get the regulatory hurdles out of drug approvals and get more drugs to market faster', 'On Medicaid, we’ve got a couple changes in Medicaid that will drive down drug prices', 'One of the ones we talk about is the way to — the Inspector General actually found a bunch of examples of drugs that were mistreated as branded drugs when they should have been generic and it cost us an absolute fortune', 'We’re going to try and — we’re proposing now in this budget to change the rules, to make clear that things like the EpiPen should be a lot cheaper than they are', 'Keep in mind, we’re one of the largest purchasers of drugs in the United States', 'In fact, I think the government probably is, through Medicaid and the VA and Medicare', 'So when we can figure out a way to save money on programs like that, it goes straight to the bottom line, critically, without reducing anybody’s benefits', 'When we talk about Medicare, we talk about Medicaid today — and I’m going to finish by talking about some Part D stuff — we are talking about things that lower drug prices and save money for folks who are in these programs', 'We are not talking, in a single instance, about denying anybody coverage, raising anybody’s age, doing any means testing', 'It’s the same message you heard last year', 'The President was not willing, because of the promises he made on the campaign trail, to deal with those entitlement programs', 'But I think I can make the case to you that figuring out a way to get drug prices down is absolutely consistent with his campaign promises', 'We’re also going to try and clarify the Medicaid definition of brand versus over-the-counter drugs, and biologics and — oh, this is interesting — we’re giving the states — we’re giving up to five states, within Medicaid, a test program to allow them to try to limit their formulary and to negotiate drug prices', 'People always ask all the time, “Why don’t you all negotiate drug prices', '” Well, if you always are going to admit every — just have every drug in the world on your formulary, negotiating prices doesn’t do anything because people know you have to take the drug at the end of the day', 'And you have to be able to limit your formulary — the drugs that you will cover — in order for negotiation to make any sense at all, to have any effect at all', 'So we’re proposing, through Medicaid, to do a test program with up to five states — to allow them, if they want to, to limit their formulary and then negotiate drug prices on their own', 'Q Are you talking about inelastic versus elastic', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, I’m not', 'Come on now', 'Give me a chance —', 'Q Okay', 'I was just asking', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: All right', 'Good', 'No', 'Part D — we talk about Part D proposals', 'A couple different things here', 'As many of you know who follow the healthcare industry, a lot of the manufacturers provide rebates to the various health plans', 'But seniors very rarely, if ever, see it', 'So what the senior is paying out of pocket isn’t really impacted by the rebate', 'One of the proposals here is that, at least one-third of those rebates have to be passed on to the purchasers at the point of sale', 'It’s going to have the impact of lowering the out-of-pocket costs to folks who are on Medicare', 'We’re establishing a true — for the first time — true out-of-pocket cap for seniors', 'Once we start lowering these prices we can do that', 'Right now, there’s an incentive for drug companies to try and rush people through the doughnut hole to get them to catastrophic, where the government picks up big chunks of the cost', 'And we’re trying to figure out a way — we’re actually proposing ways to get rid of those incentives', 'And then one of my favorites is, we’re limiting the amount that they can raise prices within Medicare', 'I think is in Part B not Part D', 'But right now — and I had no idea — that once, if I take your drug onto my formulary in Medicare and it’s $100, next year I don’t limit the amount that you can raise the price', 'In fact, I do, but it’s not much of a limit', 'And drugs actually get more expensive as they stay on the formulary longer, which is absolutely crazy', 'That’s the only business I know where a products get more expensive the longer they’ve been on the market', 'So one of the things we’re doing, is we’re limiting the increases in those prices to actual cost of inflation', 'That by itself saves us a tremendous amount of money', 'Lastly, within — well, we’re doing a couple other — the last thing on drug prices: the 340B program', 'I think this is getting a little bit of attention because I saw some ads on that on television', 'Right now, there’s some folks who game the system', 'There’s folks who don’t', 'There’s companies — health providers that don’t provide charity care so they can’t take advantage of the 340B program', 'And what they do is they’ll buy small, private providers who do provide charity care, and then they’ll take advantage of that to apply 340B treatment to their entire system', 'Did I get that right, Grogan', 'MR', 'GROGAN: Yep', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Good', 'All right, so that’s a lot of things we’re doing on drug prices', 'Opioids, again, $3 billion last year, $10 billion this year', 'On top of that, I think there’s a couple hundred million dollars — there’s $100 million from us on a pilot program we’re trying to do with NIH to specifically get private industry to participate in research, to get us to non-addictive pain — a pain replacement for opioids', 'One of the most interesting things, I think, we’ve come up with — very excited about that work', 'SNAP', 'Food stamps', 'A couple of changes there', 'We’ll hit the highlights', 'You may have heard about this already: the Food Box Program', 'One of the most innovative things — actually, I think it originated at the USDA', 'Secretary Perdue wanted to give it a chance', 'We thought it was a tremendous idea so what we do is propose that, for folks who are on food stamps — part, not all — part of their benefits come in the actually sort of — and I don’t want to steal somebody’s copyright — but a Blue Apron-type program where you actually receive the food instead of receive the cash', 'It lowers the cost to us because we can buy prices at wholesale, whereas they have to buy it at retail', 'It also makes sure that they’re getting nutritious food', 'So we’re pretty excited about that', 'That’s a tremendous cost savings', 'We’re also — contained within SNAP and a lot of the other welfare programs — a lot of the able-bodied work requirements that you’ve heard us talk about last year, and during this year', 'Repeal and replace Obamacare — that’s fine, we talk about that', 'We talk about welfare reform, that’s mostly focused on able-boded adults', 'Medicare, we talked about some that', 'Drug prices', 'That farm bill subsidy, same as last year where we try and limit the subsidies to farmers who have adjusted-gross incomes of less than $500,000 — AGI of less than $500,000', 'Not only, on an orderly year, are we still going to cover 98 percent of farmers with that, as I point out to all my farm friends, when you have a bad year, your AGI will drop below $500,000 and you would qualify for some of the benefits and so forth', 'So that hits the highlights on 2019', 'If I go to the next slide — I’m almost done, I promise', 'Macro, because we get a lot of this', 'We’ve changed the macroeconomic assumptions from last year slightly, as you would imagine', 'Here would — our assumptions last year for the GDP growth', 'Remember we had 2', '3, 2', '5, 2', '8, and then we ramped up to 3', '0 [percent]', 'Yes, I will take some pleasure in realizing that a lot of you accused me being crazy when I said that', 'Q Why do you point at me', '(Laughter', ')', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Because you just think I’m crazy anyway', '(Laughter', ') So, like remember we —', 'Q That doesn’t mean we don’t love you', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I mean, listen, I’ll take 15 seconds to pat ourselves on the back', 'We did even better', 'I mean, there are people who thought we were crazy to introduce 2', '3 last year and we blew that out of the water', 'I can’t wait to go to my Senate House hearings and talk to some of my friends, including my old buddy, Chris Van Hollen, who said it was the craziest thing he’s ever seen', 'We beat that number last year', 'So I think it’s completely reasonable for us to ramp things up a little bit', 'We came up to 3', '1, 3', '2, we do think — obviously, we think we can hit all of these numbers', 'You will notice that, towards the end, we tail off instead of maintaining the 3 [percent] all the way across', 'That was just a — that was from the CEA, driven — that’s part of the normal business cycles', 'We don’t expect it to actually stay 3 [percent] the whole way', 'On interest rates, we did two different ways', 'The 90-day Treasury and a 10-year Treasury', 'We came up a little bit on the 90 and then down a little bit on the 10-year, just because we think that’s what the reality has looked like', 'So, on the CPI, the same thing', 'We thought we’d see inflation a little bit higher', 'We continue not to see it', 'So we’ve adjusted our inflation down a little bit, just for the couple of years', 'You can see on the “out years,” a lot of these numbers are almost entirely the same', 'The unemployment numbers, similarly — our experience, with a years’ worth of — under our belts — has been that the rates are trending a little bit lower than we expected', 'Keep in mind, if we end up missing here — and a lot of folks will say, “Well, Mulvaney, what happens if you end up with an interest rate here next year because of 3', '6', '” Well, one the primary driving reasons of that would be if the GDP number is actually higher than we expect it to be', 'Keep in mind, one point increase in GDP over the 10-year window is roughly $3', '25 trillion off of the deficit', 'One additional point, here, across ten years, takes the deficit down by $3', '25 trillion', 'Yes, an interest rate up of a 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, costs us about 1', '5, $1', '6 trillion in that same year', 'But as long as we’ve got GDP growing fast, we’ve got interest rates, the deficit will be going down', 'Lastly, it’s not shown here, but folks are going to ask me about the impact of the tax bill on revenues', 'And yeah, you’re going to see a spike in the deficit over what we had originally expected this year because we — tax revenues are going down', 'But our analysis already shows that over the 10 years — and I don’t have a slide on this one, so we just got this one in this afternoon — over the 10 years, we will actually — we are generating more money for the Treasury than the CBO baseline that has — that was written before the tax bill', 'So the tax bill actually does generate additional saving, additional revenue to the Treasury than we’d have without it', 'In fact, in the last year, that both our budget and the CBO baseline line up — we’re generating almost $400 billion extra every single year because of the tax bill, and because of our growth assumptions, and the growth we’ve already experienced', 'And that number just continues to get bigger, out into the future', 'You do have increased deficits for the first five years because revenues are down', 'All right, lastly, if I can go to slide seven, please', 'All right, so this is the question, right — does it balance', 'No, it doesn’t', 'I said last year — in fact, I want to get this right — I did an interview last year with the Washington Examiner, and it said, “The longer we wait to make the reforms, the spending proposals that we made in last year’s budget, the harder it gets to actually balance', '” That’s why I don’t think we would be able to balance the budget next year unless we actually make some of the changes this year that we proposed', 'And we didn’t', 'In fact, we didn’t make hardly any of the proposals', 'I think there’s probably — we sent up $54 billion worth of savings last year to the Hill, and they took about $5 billion worth of it', 'They didn’t make any of the large structural changes that we proposed', 'And listen, I probably could have made it balance, but you all would have, rightly, just absolutely excoriated us for using funny numbers because it would have taken funny numbers to do it', 'These are real numbers', 'We have a lot fewer plugs in here this year, mostly because we have better data', 'Remember, last year, it was a transition budget', 'We have a lot fewer plugs this year', 'We have a lot more support for these numbers', 'These numbers are good numbers', 'And I’m very proud of the work that the folks at OMB have done to give us solid numbers', 'But I couldn’t come in here and tell you, using solid numbers, that we can balance in 10 years, because we can’t', 'And I think there’s — I hope there’s some value in being honest with people about what the fiscal situation is', 'But we don’t balance during the 10-year window', 'What we do do, however, is we’re able to turn the tide, to turn the trajectory, especially when you measure GDP — or debt as a percentage of GDP', 'We peak about 80 percent here in ’20, ’21, ’22', 'We get it down the other way', 'If I could go to the next slide, please', 'And you can see the difference between what we’re proposing in our budget and what we think the real world looks like', 'The real world here is blue, and our budget is orange', 'What was the second message of this document', 'The first message: You don’t have to spend it all, but if you do, this is how you spend it', 'The second message is: We are not condemned to trillion-dollar deficits forever', 'There is a way out of this', 'By the way, we do all of this, okay, without changing Medicare — or at least the benefits that people get with Medicare', 'We’ve always talked about the drug stuff without changing the major parts of Medicare or without changing Social Security retirement', 'There is a way to get off of this treadmill of trillion-dollar deficits, but we have to take the spending side extraordinarily seriously', 'The budget — and I’ll close with this — the budget represents $3 trillion in savings over the course of the 10 years', 'It’s the second largest proposed reduction in spending ever, second only to last year’s budget', 'It’s $1', '7 billion in mandatory savings, which I think is —', 'STAFF MEMBER: Trillion', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: $1', '7 trillion', 'Excuse me, $3 trillion in total savings over the 10 years, and $1', '7 of that — $1', '7 trillion is in mandatory, which I think is the largest ever', 'So the President — no one can say the President doesn’t take this seriously', 'We are not, sort of, resigning ourselves to trillion-dollar deficits forever', 'He is making some tough choices, but he’s doing it in a smart way that will still allow us to fund our priorities, to run the country, and to see tremendous economic growth', 'With that, I’ll take some questions', 'Yes, sir', 'Q You had talked a little bit about who are the budget winners, if you will', 'Potentially, who would be the budget losers', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: How would you define a loser', 'My guess is, a loser would be a program that doesn’t work', 'Let’s give you an example of that', 'Workforce — I forgot to talk about workforce', 'It is a priority for us, and I just didn’t make the screen, and I apologize for that', 'In workforce, a classic example of how we try to set up this budget: The winners are the apprenticeship programs', 'The losers are things like Trade Adjustment Assistance, okay', 'We reform TAA', 'Why', 'Because it doesn’t seem to work', 'In fact, the data that we have seems to suggest that folks who go through that program actually end up in lower-paying jobs than folks who don’t go through the program, okay', 'So there’s a program that screams out for either less spending or reform, or both', 'The flipside of that are these apprenticeship programs where we actually have some hard data that says that people who go through the apprenticeship programs actually come out with more pay and better jobs on the backend', 'And for that reason, we double funding, within this FY19 budget, for the apprenticeship programs', 'So the answer to your question is, the losers — to use your word — are programs that don’t work anymore', 'Yes, sir', 'Q I wanted to ask — this is mentioned in the budget — about civil service reform', 'It uses the term, “Hire the best, fire the worst', '” How hard is the administration going to push for that, in terms of —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks for that, because that didn’t make the high level of the presentation', 'The proposal on hiring the best, firing the worst works like this', 'You’re going to see that we did not propose a civilian pay raise this year', 'Instead, what we’ve done is we’ve set up a $1 billion fund with an idea towards giving managers the ability to pay people whose performance actually merits the increase, as opposed to giving folks automatic increases', 'I don’t remember the numbers off the top of my head, but it’s in the high 90s of federal workers get automatic, performance-based increases every single year', 'STAFF MEMBER: 99', '7 [percent]', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: 99', '7', 'Like I said, it’s —', 'Q 91 or —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: It’s 99', '7 automatically get performance-based increases every year', 'I think it’s fair to say that maybe that’s not a true performance-based indicator', 'And what we’d like to do is simply say, look, if you are one of those folks who really is a good government worker, you should get a raise', 'If you’re not, you’re not', 'In fact, our own internal studies at the government level point that one of the top complaints by federal workers about their job is that their pay is not tied to their performance', 'And they see folks who they know aren’t pulling the weight getting the same increases that the folks who are pulling the weight are getting, and that’s very frustrating to them', 'So one of the biggest things we’re trying to do through the management — of the “M” side of OMB — remember, “M” is for Office of Management and Budget — is to change the way that we hire and fire', 'But to this point, specifically, pay', 'I’ll go there in a second', 'I promised this young lady the next question', 'Q Thank you', 'I want to go back', 'You addressed this just a little bit, but I want to go back to this claim by the administration that the tax reform bill would wind up paying for itself', 'This year, though, it looks like revenues — revenues are sharply lower', 'If you look at last year’s revenue baseline for 2018 to ’27, it was almost $47 trillion', 'But if you plug in this year’s baseline for those years, it equals $3', '7 trillion less', 'How does that work', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah', 'A couple of different things', 'First of all, you’ve asked, sort of, two different questions', 'The idea of the tax bill reaping the benefits is a long period thing, but you also said the impacts for this year', 'But let’s look at the long period, because you’re absolutely right, there is about a $3', '7 trillion difference', 'And in talking with Treasury — and we’re getting more guidance on this tonight, I understand, from Treasury — that breaks down as follows: About $1', '4 trillion of it is what the Treasury calls their technical adjustments', 'These are adjustments that Treasury makes to their formulas and their methodology every single year', 'And they will tell you, and you get more detail on this from Treasury this evening, and Mnuchin — Steven Mnuchin and I are both testifying this week about this, so we’ll have more data on this — is that these are about $1', '4 trillion in changes that would take place without the tax bill', 'Okay', 'So you take part of $3', '7 and throw the $1', '4 away', 'Half a trillion dollars of it is we assume that the individuals tax rates are extended, that the cuts to the individuals rates are extended throughout the budget window', 'And that costs an additional half a trillion dollars', 'So that’s above the technical bill', 'Right', 'The bill — we all talked about how the fact the bill was written in such a way as to score, in a certain manner, the CBO', 'But we said no, those are good policies', 'Those policies should stay in place', 'The last — the other difference, which is between $1', '8 and $1', '9 trillion over the life of the program, deals with how the Treasury scores, believe it or not, the Obamacare repeal portion of the tax bill, and not taxes itself', 'But I’ll let Treasury fill that more in later on tonight', 'In the back, please', 'Q You talk about —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, you can wait, please', 'You’ve always yelled out when everybody else raises their hands', 'So you can wait to —', 'Q I am raising my hand', 'Q I want to go back to what you’ve talked about with interest rates and inflation, about both possibly moving lower', 'Where it seems to be — you know, a lot of the market turmoil we had last week, there was concern about both moving higher — interest rates and inflation', 'So I’m wondering how worried you are about the bond market at some point kind of forcing your hand on this and forcing spending cuts, and not being able to go through with some of the spending plans that you have', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, well, the traditional — the orthodox answer to that, from a macroeconomic position, would be, yeah, we’re supposed to be concerned about that', 'Right', 'Every time we’re going to — you see GDP go up or borrowing go up, you should see interest rates go up', 'The fact of the matter, though, is, aside from the little spike that we’ve had in the last 10 days, we’ve not seen that for a long time', 'In fact, if you follow some of the economic literature, you’ll see that one of the great topics of debate amongst macroeconomists the world around right now is, “Where has inflation been', '” We’ve had some growth all over the place, and we’ve just not seen that inflation', 'I could opine as to where that might be', 'I mean, maybe the labor markets are a lot slacker than the numbers would indicate', 'Maybe the labor force participation rate can come up a good bit without creating inflation', 'Maybe it’s a supply-side type of inflation that doesn’t lead to the same type of inflationary —', 'Q But you’re making assumptions in this that —', 'DIRECTORY MULVANEY: Well, yeah', 'You have to but — look, let’s be perfectly clear', 'We have to make assumptions', 'There’s no question', 'All we’ve done is we’ve made assumptions that we think are defensible, just as they were last year, and we’ve adjusted them in order to account for an additional year’s worth of data', 'So we absolutely stand by the economic assumptions', 'Yes, ma’am', 'Q Yes, so you said that, in 10 years, the budget doesn’t balance', 'But do you see it balancing ever again', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: We stopped at 10 years', 'And that was a philosophical conversation we had because, if I could come in here today and say, well, it doesn’t balance in 10 years, but it balances in 17, or 27, or 37, I think that might undermine the credibility of the numbers', 'And our goal here was to give the American people and to give Congress real numbers', 'And so that’s why we stopped at 10 years', 'Do you have a follow-up on that or no', 'Q Yeah, one additional question', 'You mentioned that the amount — the $18 billion put aside for border wall —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah', 'Q — is based on a DACA deal', 'What if there isn’t a DACA deal', 'Does that mean no border wall money', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Then Congress will never give us the money', 'Q So no border wall money unless there’s a DACA deal', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, no, no, no', 'There’s two different pieces', 'Thank you for that clarification', 'No, what’s hardwired into the appropriations process is $1', '6 billion for ’18, and I think $3 billion —', 'STAFF MEMBER: $1', '6 billion again', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: $1', '6 billion, again, for ’19', 'Okay', 'And then goes back — that’s been — that $1', '6 [billion] for ’19 has been in there since last year', 'And that’s what we want for the border wall, regardless of DACA', 'Now, the President has already said if we have a comprehensive immigration deal, if we have a DACA deal, part of that deal must be fully securing the southern border', 'And that’s where that $18 to $25 billion comes into play', 'Q But the $25 [billion] is what has been — what they’ve said they want', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, but I think if you look — and again, that number has changed a couple of different times — but I think the $25 [billion] is all border security, including a wall', 'I think the bricks-and-mortar component of that is about $18 [billion]', 'Yes, ma’am', 'Q Two questions', 'A technical one and a philosophical one', 'First, on Medicaid and Medicare, you talked about savings through — and there seems to be a lot of payment savings in there — can you tell us what the total savings number would be', 'Is it that $236 [billion]', 'Is it a larger number', 'And second, when the administration chooses to not fully spend all of the money that has been allowed for in the caps, are you sending a message, particularly to conservative members of the House, that they shouldn’t support spending bills that spend all of that money, and, therefore, making it harder to continue with a regular order appropriations, of which Congress hasn’t been able to do for nearly a decade', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Okay, let me answer the first one first because I think that’s the shorter one', 'The answer is $236 billion', 'I’ve heard a number today on the media about half a billion or something like that, and that’s just not right', 'It’s $236 billion', 'The other stuff is stuff where we simply moved spending out of the Medicare trust fund and fund it someplace else', 'The two biggest examples there are — believe it or — and I didn’t know this until this year', 'I don’t know if you folks know this or not', 'Do you know that your Medicare — when you pay your FICA every single month, some of that money goes to pay graduate medical school tuition', 'I had no idea that was the case', 'Okay', 'And we stopped that, and used other monies to pay for that', 'That’s part of that 500', 'Another thing that your Medicare money goes to pay for every single year is bad debts incurred by hospitals from non-Medicare patients', 'So if I go into a hospital and I get treatment — I’m not on Medicare — and I don’t pay my bill, Medicare will pay some of that cost to that hospital', 'We didn’t think that was right', 'We thought that was contributing to the early decline of the Medicare trust fund', 'So we changed those programs', 'We fund them out of the base, okay', 'So the real number of the reduced spending in Medicare is $236 billion', 'Did I get that right', 'Good', 'Now, keep in mind, we manage, as part of these fairly modest changes — in fact — oh, by the way, can I — yeah, go ahead', 'Can you go to the next slide real quick', 'Okay', 'This is what we just talked about', 'Okay', 'These are the ones we talk about — the spending removed from trust funds and some other stuff', 'And this is our Medicare-specific proposal', 'That’s the $236 [billion] I talked about', 'Okay', 'With this modest reforms, within — we can produce this', 'So you guys don’t have to worry about taking pictures if you don’t want to', 'Q Okay', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: But with these modest reforms, we believe that we extend the viability of the Medicare trust fund by eight years', 'Okay', 'That’s how — not easy it is to fix, but that’s how critical it is to fix these things', 'If you can go back now, because I’ll move on to the next topic', 'If you go back to the previous slide', 'Thank you', 'Now, are we sending the message not to vote', 'No', 'The message is very clear', 'Okay', 'Keep in mind, the two numbers between ’18 and ’19 are almost exactly the same', 'The difference in the caps are $10 billion', 'Okay', 'So the message is really simple: You don’t have to spend it, and if something happens between now and the appropriations bills — and face it, we’re all kidding ourselves', 'There are not going to be any appropriations bills passed out of Congress', 'They’re going to do another omni, right', 'But if something happens between now and the next omni or the next CR, and they say, wait a second, maybe we are concerned about the deficit — maybe we don’t want to spend all this money — they have something on the shelf they can go look at and say, look, this is what we could do', 'However if they decide they do want to spend — and that’s our ’19 budget — if they want to spend all of it, and they want to know what administration’s priorities are in spending all of that, they’ve got our ’18 budget to look at', 'Yes, sir', 'Q As a one-time deficit hawk, just simply —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, still-time deficit hawk', 'Thank you', 'Q Okay, well, that, I think, adds even more to question', 'How can you say that this is not hypocritical', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Did I tell you the story about NIH', 'I mean, who spends money', 'You know the question', 'Who spends — who appropriates money', 'I set up a budget — you know, what’s the answer', 'Who appropriates money', 'Q The Congress', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: That’s exactly right', 'And I’m sorry, you sit in Acosta’s seat, so I had to ask you the Acosta question', 'You know, we sent up $54 billion worth of reductions last year; they took $5 [billion], and pounded the hell out of me while they were doing it, right', 'So I mean, I know what the attitude is on the Hill', 'And that’s why we wanted to send both of these budgets', 'We’d love to see them spend less', 'Okay', 'The President himself tweeted this weekend that we had to accept a bunch of additional non-defense discretionary spending in order to get the defense spending we wanted', 'He said we had to accept a bunch of waste in extra spending in order to get that', 'That’s not ideal', 'If you left it to the President of the United States, he’d fund defense', 'If it were up to the President of the United States, we’d do what we just talked about in 2019 budget', 'So, no', 'I think that was one of the things that really surprised him during the caps discussion, which is that the Democrats would look him in the eye and say, “We want to fund defense too', '” And every time he said, “I’d like a dollar for defense,” they said, “Well, we can only give you that if you give us a dollar over here', '” And I think that really surprised him', 'So, no, it’s not hypocritical', 'It’s simply adjusting to the Washington, D', 'C', 'that we live in, and a Washington, D', 'C', 'where we have to have Democrat votes to support any spending bill at all', 'Because every spending bill takes 60 votes', 'Does that answer your question', 'Q So a Democratic administration — let’s say there is one in 4 years, 8 years, 12 years, whatever', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Right', 'Q Will you be a deficit hawk then', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I will always be a deficit hawk', 'I am today, I was yesterday, and will be tomorrow because I do think that spending a bunch of money that we don’t have is wrong', 'I’m just telling you that this is the cards that we’ve been dealt as an administration', 'This is how we would prefer to spend the money if it’s going to get spent', 'We just don’t think you have to spend all of it', 'Yes, ma’am', 'Q Can I follow up quickly on that', 'And then I have another one', 'Because the underlying budget, without taking into account the caps agreement —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes', 'Q — also doesn’t balance in 10 years, right', 'You never eliminate deficits in the 10-year window', 'So is the President just now resigned to the fact that because he has to work with Congress on the budget that it never can be balanced', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, keep in mind — well, that goes back to what I talked about the end — during the budget last year, which is — I think what I said is that we don’t start moving the needle really, really quickly, the window is going to close on being able to balance within 10 years', 'And if we didn’t start moving the —', 'Q So the window is already closed', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah', 'Yes, it is', 'I think I said last year that I expected last year’s budget — I think I stood here at this podium and said, “I think this will probably be the last budget we can balance within the 10-year window, unless there’s dramatic changes', '” And there weren’t any dramatic changes', 'We knew last year that we’d be facing this, and that’s — again, that’s just the reality of the situation', 'Yes, ma’am', 'Q Quick follow-up on entitlement cuts', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah', 'Q You talked about Medicare', 'There’s also, I believe — I think more than a trillion in Medicaid spending cuts, or you were moving money around that goes to Medicaid into grant programs that are discretionary', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah', 'Q Can you talk about the other entitlements that are affected in that $1', '7 trillion', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, I don’t about — where’s the $1', '7 trillion coming from', 'Q That’s the overall cuts you’re looking for in mandatory spending', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Oh, oh', 'I’m sorry', 'Yeah, okay', 'Thanks very much', 'And I don’t know the allocation of that that’s part of Medicaid', 'Because keep in mind, when you talk about mandatory spending, most people think that it’s Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, but it’s actually a lot more than just that', 'So it wouldn’t be fair to say, okay, if you have $1', '7 trillion in mandatory savings, and you’ve only got $236 billion in Medicare, then all the rest comes from Medicaid', 'That’s not accurate', 'So I don’t know what the number is in Medicaid', 'But I will tell you this about our Medicaid which is, the biggest assumptions that we made — proposals that we make — is to go ahead and pass Graham-Cassidy — the Obamacare repeal and replace bill which transitions Medicaid to a block-grant system to the states', 'Under the proposal, the block grants to the states would actually go up every single year', 'Every single year', 'Or every single year except one', 'Every single year, Grogan', 'Our block grants to the states, or is that one year where we have that sort of dip', 'STAFF MEMBER: Every year', 'Q At what rate', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I don’t remember what the — oh, the rate is slower than — that’s the other change', 'So we assume Graham-Cassidy for Medicaid, but we grow it at the CPI — CPI medical or CPI —', 'STAFF MEMBER: CPI-U', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: — CPI-U instead of CPI medical because our data is that the historical, actual growth rates of Medicaid costs has been CPI-U and not CPI Medicaid', 'So what we’re saying is we think that that program has been growing faster than it needs to in order to provide the same level of services', 'So those are our two biggest changes to Medicaid', 'Yes, ma’am', 'Q Yes', 'I want to go to, really fast, Pell Grant and SNAP', 'I want to get into the weeds about the SNAP issue, what you said about Blue Apron', 'Is this an effort to help —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: And we call it a food box', 'Blue Apron is a private business, so I want to make clear: We are not hiring Blue Apron to do this', 'It’s a food box program, but people know what Blue Apron is', 'Q And I want to get into weeds about that', 'What is going to be in that box', 'Is it going to be like fresh vegetables', 'Because, I mean, if you follow the example of some of these boxed food commercial programs, they’re having some issues, I guess', 'And will you be utilizing the U', 'S', 'Postal Service with this', 'Is this an effort to help bolster the Postal Service as well', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, I don’t know about the Postal Service question', 'STAFF MEMBER: It’s — the states will be able to —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Okay, it goes to the individual state', 'As to the actual food box program, I think we’re using the current program for seniors as a model, but we’re getting rid of — by the way, in the budget, you will see that we’re getting rid of the current food box program for seniors', 'Been doing it for a long time, right', 'And that’s not because we’re not going to feed the seniors food', 'All we’re doing is folding those folks into the food box program', 'So we’re going from a food stamp — a SNAP program and a food box for seniors, and we’re putting everybody together in one program', 'So when you see that, please get clarifications', 'But what I’ve been told from USDA, it’s 100 percent domestically grown food', 'And it has been pitched as being more nutritious than what may otherwise be', 'Last question', 'Yeah, follow-up', 'Yes, ma’am', 'Q Yeah, Pell Grants', 'What is the plus again, and why that number', 'Why did you plus it up to that number', 'That was one of your first things that you did on the first one — the first chart', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can’t remember what the plus-up is on Pell Grant, but I do know that the big substantive change is we expanded Pell Grant to go to the short-term program so they can used for vocational training and stuff', 'Is that what it was', 'STAFF MEMBER: The number you had was a rescission that we had taken', 'We are (inaudible) Pell as a short-term programs', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Okay', 'So we’re expanding — the number you saw on the screen was a rescission', 'That’s one of those smoke and mirrors things, okay', 'But the expansion to the program — yeah, rescissions and CHIMPs and carry-forward balances, I’ve learned a lot more about these than I ever care to think about', 'But the expansion to the Pell program is to the short-term program', 'So that would qualify folks for vocational training, which a lot of times don’t qualify for Pell', 'Q So it’s summer, winter — it’s all-year round, now, vocations schools', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, well I think we did all year last', 'Q Yeah, it’s all year now, and you’re adding vocational', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: We did year-round last year, and now we’re adding a short-term', 'Last question', 'Q Thank you', 'The defense budget', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah', 'Q This morning, the President said, we’re going to be so far ahead of everyone else in nuclear', 'How much of this budget addresses that statement today in addressing the nuclear arsenal and the increase', 'And do you have specific numbers as to how much it’s going to increase, how many weapons that translates to', 'STAFF MEMBER: Within NSA, it’s an $11 billion budget', 'That does not include the platforms themselves, which are about another $24 billion — about $35 [billion]', 'We’ll get you exact numbers', 'Q Thanks', 'And then the follow up to that question is, what’s the impetus for this', 'What’s the philosophy behind it', 'Does this administration believe that we can win a nuclear war', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, I think the President has been very clear that he expects to have the very best weapons available', 'And that the nuclear arsenal has not been updated for a long time, and that he wants to do that', 'It was a priority in last year’s budget', 'This is not news', 'This is —', 'Q I’m just trying — I’m trying to understand', 'Please help me', 'Because we have — I mean, it was Carl Sagan who said, our nuclear deterrent policy is like two kids sitting in a room full of gasoline arguing over how many matches we have', 'I mean, we can blow up the world plenty', 'Why aren’t we leading the world in —', 'DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, I think you heard the President say today that he’d love not to have these', 'But we have them because other folks have them', 'Q But we’re not leading the way', 'DIRECTORY MULVANEY: Okay', 'I am not going to take any questions because, honestly, I’m just whipped', 'I’ve been doing this for four days', 'But John Czwartacki is here', 'We’ll be happy to take all of your individual questions, follow up over the course of the next couple of days', 'And we will be on the Hill the next few days', 'Thanks, you all', 'END', '5:09 P', 'M', 'EST']\n",

and two fatalities as it moved across Florida, and now up the Eastern Seaboard', 'Eric Fisher is chief meteorologist at our CBS affiliate WBZ in Boston -- Eric', 'ERIC FISHER, WBZ METEOROLOGIST: Good morning, John', 'Very tricky storm we have been tracking here over these last several days, and the latest trend, a little farther to the east', 'That’s what we saw overnight tonight', 'So, many along the coastline will see conditions deteriorate over time as we head into overnight tonight and Monday', 'Our tropical storm warnings are still up from the Mid-Atlantic, up to coastal Connecticut, tropical storm watches in southeastern New England', 'And here’s the latest track, staying a little farther to the east', 'What that means is, a lot less rainfall, really no rain, except for right along the immediate coast late tonight and Monday getting some showers, but the heaviest rain stays offshore', 'At the same time, it’s still a very strong storm, big wind field', 'It’s going to move very slowly', 'So, as we head through Sunday into Monday and into Tuesday, those strong winds churning up the surf', 'And so our main impacts are going to be still some coastal flooding, also a lot of beach erosion from the Mid-Atlantic up into New England, rain totals low, some even seeing the sun, but the beaches really taking a beating this Labor Day weekend -- John', 'DICKERSON: All right, Eric Fisher, thanks so much', 'Turning now to the other big story this weekend, campaign 2016', 'Our CBS News Battleground Tracker today looks at North Carolina, where Hillary Clinton is up by four points over Donald Trump, 46 to 42 percent', 'In Pennsylvania, a state Donald Trump promises he will win, Clinton enjoys a comfortable lead, with 45 percent to 37 percent for Trump', 'We have added Arizona and Georgia to our original 11 battleground states', 'So, now, if we look at the race in the 13 most potentially competitive states, Hillary Clinton is up by two points over Donald Trump, 42-40 percent', 'The remaining voters are either undecided or supporting a third- party candidate', 'Joining us now from his home in Mendham, New Jersey, is Governor Chris Christie', 'Governor, before we get back to politics, quickly on Hurricane Hermine', 'You declared a state of emergency', 'What is the situation, as you see it now', 'GOV', 'CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), NEW JERSEY: Well, as you just heard in the forecast, John, we got some good news overnight that the storm was tracking a little further east, which will mean less water', 'We still expect in our three southernmost counties, where we did declare a state of emergency, Cape May, Atlantic and Ocean counties, that we will still have moderate flooding starting later today -- later today into tomorrow, because of the slow-moving nature of the storm', 'But, so far, unless it makes a turn back west, which these storms always can do, unless that happens, I think that we are going to look at moderate flooding, rather than a very severe impact', 'DICKERSON: All right, let’s switch now to politics', 'You helped set up the meeting this week between Donald Trump and the Mexican president', 'What was the point of that meeting', 'CHRISTIE: Well, listen, I think that what Donald Trump wants to show everyone is that he will be a leader for all Americans', 'And he will be someone who is going to reach out, even when he has some disagreements with a foreign leader, to reach and out open dialogue', 'And I think the words he used at the end of that meeting were very important, that he enjoyed the meeting, that he likes President Pena Nieto, and that he thinks they can work together to help improve the economies of Mexico and the United States', 'All those things are very important', 'And I think those are things that they also stand for, which are that they’re going to fight for the people of their country', 'I don’t think anyone expected anything less from a President Trump or a President Pena Nieto, but I think the meeting was to make sure everybody understands that this is going to be a president who will work with our allies to make sure that lives of citizens in both countries improve over the next four years', 'DICKERSON: So, after the meeting, Donald Trump then gave a speech in Arizona in which he said, “They don’t know it, but they’re going to pay for the wall', '” He was talking about Mexico', 'After setting up a meeting to show this part of his character and building a relationship with Mexico, why say something like that to show that he’s dominating the Mexicans, or would as president', 'How does that work', 'Isn’t that a mixed message', 'CHRISTIE: No', 'No, John, I think he was just being candid', 'That’s one of the areas that obviously they disagree upon and are going to have to be topic of further discussion going forward', 'But I think what Donald was doing was being very candid with the American people about, this is one of the areas where they disagree', 'This is the kind of transparency you get from Donald Trump, as opposed to what you get from Hillary Clinton, who hasn’t had a press conference in nearly 10 months, hides, doesn’t answer questions, except for high-dollar donors', 'I mean, the fact is that Donald Trump is going to tell you exactly what he thinks', 'Sometimes, you will agree it', 'Sometimes, you won’t', 'But you will never have to wonder', 'Hillary Clinton, she’s the mystery woman of 2016', 'All we know is that she has told us she had one device, so that’s why she’s a private e-mail server, John', 'And now we find out this week from the FBI 13 different mobile devices and five different iPads, most of which are now gone', 'DICKERSON: The wall that Donald Trump was talking about, do you that is really going to happen, that Mexico is going to pay for it', 'CHRISTIE: Listen, I think that Donald Trump has negotiated some extraordinary deals over the course of time in his career', 'And this will be another challenging deal for him to negotiate', 'But I absolutely believe that is the way he sees it, and it will be part of an overall negotiation with Mexico to improve the economies in both countries and to make sure that the lives of the people in both countries are protected from drug-running and gun-running and illegal immigration, which is hurting both countries, John', 'So, listen, I -- people have lost a lot of money so far in the last 16 months betting against Donald Trump', 'DICKERSON: So, because the wall is such an important part of his candidacy, you said during the primaries, “This makes no sense,” referring to the wall', '“I have met President Pena Nieto a number of times', 'I don’t think if we present him with a bill, he’s going to pay for it', '”', 'So, were you wrong then', 'CHRISTIE: Yes, I disagreed with Donald Trump at the time', 'Big shock', 'I was running against him, John', 'And so let’s pull out all the quotes where people who are now supporting Hillary Clinton disagreed with her during the primary as well, so we can be fair about this', 'Of course I disagreed with him, because I was running against him', '(CROSSTALK)', 'DICKERSON: But do you think it’s possible now', 'CHRISTIE: But, John, a lot of people -- John, a lot of people, a lot of people, myself included, have lost betting against Donald Trump', 'And I think he’s going to be a very good negotiator for the American people, not only on this issue, but on trade deals that will help improve our economy to make the world safer and more secure', 'DICKERSON: On the question of the 11 million undocumented, there’s been some confusion', 'And Donald Trump at one point said they would be leaving America so fast, it would make your head spin', 'Now he’s saying something that will be worked out', 'In the way we have seen immigration talked about, that kind of softening, to use his word, usually is prelude to not ultimately dealing with all 11 million', 'That’s what it feels like here', 'Why is that not the case', 'Why is this not basically moving away from his position he had in the primary', 'CHRISTIE: Listen, we want -- we want candidates and leaders to listen, and if they hear new information or different information that leads them to conclude different things in their positions, we want them to do that, John', 'We don’t want people stuck in cement', 'Be really clear', 'Donald Trump is going to get rid of very early on the two to three million criminals that are here illegally in this country', 'That will be priority number one', 'And once we remove those two to three million from the country, return them to their countries of origin because of their criminal conduct, then I think what Donald Trump wants to do is take a deep breath and look at where we are in the country then, and find out if you could find humane way to deal with those who remain', 'And so I think what he’s talking about is a pause', 'After the two to three million get put out of the country because they’re committing crimes, hurting Americans, selling drugs, doing things that are illegal, once those people are dealt with first -- and I think everyone agrees on that issue -- then we can deal with the remaining eight million people', 'That’s what Donald Trump wants to do', 'I think that is a humane way to deal with it', 'And I’m proud of the fact that he’s been willing to stand up and say what he really believes on this as he’s learned more about the topic', 'DICKERSON: So, your point is that this is an evolution to a pause, which shows his -- his ability to adapt to changing information', 'CHRISTIE: Absolutely', 'And that’s something that Hillary Clinton will tell you Donald Trump can’t do', 'But what I will tell you about Hillary Clinton, John, is that she doesn’t evolve', 'We don’t even know if she evolves, because she doesn’t talk to anybody, except for mega-rich donors in the Hamptons and all over America, and Hollywood and the Hamptons are the two places where Hillary Clinton answers questions, not on shows like yours', 'DICKERSON: I hear a line of attack there that might be used in the debate', 'You’re a part of the debate prep with Donald Trump', 'You also went up against him', 'How much does he really need to prepare for debates', 'CHRISTIE: Everybody needs to prepare, John', 'I mean, you need to get ready', 'And Donald is taking that process very seriously', 'But, in the end, there’s nothing you can do in preparation that can hide the essence of who you are', 'The essence of who Donald Trump is, is an outspoken, aggressive, smart, successful businessman who is going to be a strong leader for our country', 'The essence of Hillary Clinton is, she’s a political insider who over and over again has not told the truth to the American people and who thinks there’s a different set of rules that apply to her than everybody else', 'And so you are not going to be able to hide that', 'No matter how many coaches she hires, John, to help her in debate prep, it’s not going to change the essence of who she has been and who she is', 'And that is what you are going to see in the debates on September 26', 'DICKERSON: I want to ask you about a report in “Washington Post” this week about Donald Trump’s foundation paying a fine to the IRS for a $25,000 donation it had given to a political committee supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013', 'She was looking into maybe investigating Trump University, ultimately didn’t', 'Donald Trump has said he knew better than anybody how to use the system, how to use political donations to get the system to work for him', 'Is that an instance of that in that situation, gave the money, then investigation didn’t happen', 'CHRISTIE: I can’t believe, John, that anyone would insult Pam Bondi that way', 'She’s an outstanding attorney general who has been reelected by the people of Florida', 'She’s somebody who has been an outstanding law enforcement officer and continues to be', 'And I can’t imagine that Pam Bondi would ever make decisions on that basis', 'But what I will tell you is, we now know that Bill Clinton has taken over $16 million of taxpayer money to help to fund the Clinton Foundation, a foundation that essentially was the person and the group that was screening who would get to see the secretary of state', 'If you wrote your multimillion-dollar check to the Clinton Foundation, then you got a visit with the secretary of state', 'There’s no doubt about what was going on there, John, same way there was no doubt that when Hillary Clinton said she had a private e-mail server for one device, so she could use one device, we now know from the FBI she had 13 devices, one of which was destroyed with a hammer by her staff', 'Why were they hammering her cell phone, John', 'Let’s talk about the real issues of trust in this race', 'And the real issues of trust in this race -- and I can tell you this as a former prosecutor -- I’m stunned, given what I saw in the FBI files that were released Friday, that Hillary Clinton was not prosecuted', 'DICKERSON: All right, Governor Christie, we have run out of time', 'Thanks so much for being with us', 'CHRISTIE: John, I look forward to coming back', 'Thanks', 'DICKERSON: Joining us now from Phoenix is Republican Senator Jeff Flake', 'Senator, Donald Trump this week visited Mexico, met with the president there, and gave a very fiery speech in your state of Arizona', 'At the end of the week, what do you think the net result is of those two actions', 'SEN', 'JEFF FLAKE (R), ARIZONA: Well, the speech in Mexico, and that action, I think all of us had some hope after that that he might be changing the tone and tenor of his campaign', 'But then when the speech was delivered in Arizona later that day, he seemed to be right back where he has been', 'DICKERSON: What’s your understanding of how he’s going to handle the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in America', 'FLAKE: You know, that’s not clear at all', 'You know, some people, as he said, said it was heartening', 'Some said softening', 'I say it was just confusing', 'There really isn’t any -- any clear indication of whether or not, for example, kids who are brought across the border when they were 2 years old, the so-called dreamers, whether they would be forced to go back to Mexico, and if there would be visa slots for them to return to the United States, if they so choose, later on', 'So, it really is unclear right now', 'DICKERSON: You have been part of the immigration discussion in Washington', 'You spent a lot much time on the issue', 'With that experience and listening to the speech that Donald Trump gave in Arizona, how do you think his immigration plan which he plans to kick off the minute he gets in office, how would that be received in Washington', 'What would those early days and months of his administration be like', 'FLAKE: Well, any serious immigration reform has to include four elements, obviously border security', 'Donald Trump has talked quite a bit about that', 'Although, just really what element, building a wall and making Mexico pay for it, that is not a very serious policy in and of itself', 'But then you have got to talk about interior enforcement, having an E- Verify-style system to allow employers to know who they’re hiring', 'And then you have got a robust temporary worker program, both for skilled and unskilled labor', 'He’s talked very little about that', 'And then the mechanism to deal with those who are here illegally now, and that has been just kind of muddied, at best', 'DICKERSON: If you -- you talked about the tone and tenor of his campaign', 'We have had this conversation, you and I, before', 'Since then, Donald Trump has made a bit of a pivot', 'He said he regretted some things', 'He’s tried to change his position on the undocumented workers', 'He’s also kind of layered over his view about not allowing new Muslim immigration', 'Have any of those moves done anything to change your thinking about him as a president', 'FLAKE: Well, I would like to see him stick with some of those positions for awhile', 'The ban on Muslims, he does seem to have walked back', 'He’s talking more about regions or visa vetting process', 'That seems to be better', 'I’m glad to see that', 'With regard to immigration, he pivots, and then pivots right back, so it’s kind of a 360-degree pivot at times', 'So, I would like to see a firm position that he sticks with for awhile', 'And, obviously, I would like to see it a more realistic position in dealing with those who are here illegally now', 'DICKERSON: You have said a version of that before', 'Given how long you have held this position, aren’t you really at a point of no return in terms of ever supporting him', 'FLAKE: Well, it becomes increasingly difficult to see that he’s going to change', 'So, I don’t expect that I will be able to support him in November', 'I would like to, but he’s the Republican nominee', 'I just don’t see how I can', 'DICKERSON: And you have advised other Republican senators running, including John McCain in your state, to distance themselves from Donald Trump', 'John McCain in an ad appears to be doing that, saying he will be check against Hillary Clinton', 'Is he taking your advice', 'FLAKE: No, I wouldn’t suggest he’s taking my advice, but he’s doing what I think Republicans need to do', 'If we want the future of our party to be what it needs to be, we can’t associate with this kind of message and certainly with this kind of tone and the rhetoric that’s being used', 'Long term, I think that drives away young voters', 'It certainly drives away a lot of people in the minority community that we’re going to need moving ahead', 'So, I think John McCain and others are doing exactly what they need to do', 'DICKERSON: Hillary Clinton has been saying that Donald Trump is not a part of the Republican Party', 'She’s been saying there are Republicans who are not like him', 'Does actually help Republicans who are trying to win in the same year he’s running as president', 'FLAKE: It probably does for anybody to say that', 'For people to be reminded that this is not what the party stands for, I think, is a good thing', 'I wish more Republicans would say that as well, but if Hillary Clinton wants to say it, I’m glad people -- voters are being reminded of it anyway', 'DICKERSON: And finally, quickly, Senator, Hillary Clinton is spending money in Arizona, thinks it’s competitive in the general election', 'Is that just trickery, or do you think Arizona is really up for grabs in the presidential contest', 'FLAKE: It shouldn’t be up for grabs', 'Mitt Romney won it by I think, eight points', 'But, frankly, it is', 'And I think that they’re spending money because they have some indication that she might be in play', 'And, unfortunately, I think that is the case', 'DICKERSON: And is that just about Hispanic voters, or is there any other part of the vote that’s at play here', 'FLAKE: No, it’s not', 'It’s not just about Hispanic voters', 'I have always said that independent swing voters and others expect the major-party candidates to have serious policy proposals', 'And with regard to immigration, just saying that you’re going to build a wall and make Mexico pay is not a serious policy proposal', 'And I think most Arizonans know that', 'DICKERSON: All right, Senator Jeff Flake, we appreciate you being with us', 'Thanks so much', 'And we will be back in a minute', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', 'DICKERSON: We’re back now to talk numbers, more from our CBS News Battleground Tracker poll', 'We’re joined by CBS News director of elections Anthony Salvanto', 'OK, Anthony, let’s walk through this slowly', 'Thirteen, states we’re going to be obsessed with them on election night', 'They are where the race is taking place', 'Give us a sense where things now stand in those 13 battleground states', 'ANTHONY SALVANTO, CBS NEWS ELECTIONS DIRECTOR: All right', 'So, Clinton is still leading', 'And in that sense, the race is essentially unchanged', 'She is still leading among the same demographic groups that she’s been winning', 'But you look at her numbers underneath that lead, and she’s got historically high unfavorable ratings', 'That hasn’t changed either', 'So, some things that haven’t changed aren’t good news for her', 'We haven’t seen in that polling from a front-runner before', 'And what that does is, it introduces a little bit of uncertainty still in this race, because then voters say that they feel like they’re settling, like they don’t really like either choice, they have picked a front-runner, but they’re settling for a choice, rather than making an affirmative choice', 'And that leaves things, I think, still a little bit up in the air', 'DICKERSON: So, this is not an act of joy', 'They’re just kind of -- it’s a bit more grudging', 'So, let’s just recapitulate maybe for people who haven’t been paying attention what the fragility is of Hillary Clinton’s lead', 'What is underneath that is weak about her', 'SALVANTO: She still has persistent issues on trust, on telling the truth and some of it stems from the e-mail server', 'People say in this poll that they feel like her answers to that are getting less believable over time, not more so', 'But to really understand this from public opinion, John, I think you have to lather that up to the bigger picture', 'In polling, people consistently say like they feel in America today that there are two sets of rules, one for them and one for people who have special advantages', 'And it seems like the e-mail server is just reminding people of what they don’t like and what they don’t like about politics as usual', 'And then you see that and it bleeds into some of her other numbers, where people say like they feel like she is running on behalf of big donors, rather than trying to help them or help the country, and even more so that she’s running just because she wants to help herself, rather than them', 'And that’s where it spreads out and makes her numbers weaker', 'DICKERSON: Right, spreads out to a bigger issue than just about specific e-mails', 'Let’s talk about Donald Trump big challenges', 'He’s been trying to fix them', 'What’s his big challenge and how he’s been trying to fix it', 'SALVANTO: Well, you know, you look at his numbers among minority voters, they are low, and they haven’t moved just yet', 'But you wonder if too that some of these appeals to minority voters are also a signal to those reluctant Republicans that we have seen in the polling throughout this who worry', 'And they tell us they worry that his appeal is based on racial division', 'They don’t like that', 'They’re not as moved even by the immigration issue as well', 'But you see the balancing that he has', 'This week, more people said that they felt his immigration policies were staying the same, but conservatives who felt like they were changing, like they were becoming easier on people in the country illegally, got a little less enthusiastic about Trump', 'So, that that is that balancing act he’s got', 'DICKERSON: Well, this is what is so interesting', 'So, this question on immigration, it’s the signature policy of Donald Trump', 'When Chris Christie says that he’s going to take a pause about the 11 million undocumented, that would seem to be a message to those reluctant Republicans you were talking about that Donald Trump can change his mind, that he’s not doctrinaire', 'And yet, on the other hand, you have said that there are those conservatives who have always been with him who are always skeptical of presidents who are -- or candidates who are softening, who are changing their mind on that kind of thing', 'SALVANTO: Yes', 'DICKERSON: And so let’s step back look at the big picture then, the state of the map', 'What does it look like', 'SALVANTO: Well, for Hillary Clinton, she’s leading in enough states -- and we have gone through over the week state by state -- that she’s got enough of a cushion in the states that she can even afford to drop a couple, to lose her lead in a couple, and still get elected', 'We hear so much about battleground states like Ohio and Florida', 'She could even afford to lose them and still win, if she keeps the leads in some of these other places, like a North Carolina', 'DICKERSON: And that’s because Democrats start with a group of states that are traditionally voting for Democrats', 'So, they have a bit of an advantage', 'And she’s doing well in enough broad states in these battleground states', 'So, what does the path look like then for Donald Trump', 'SALVANTO: Donald Trump has more challenges, quite frankly', 'And it’s not just numerically, in that he has to pull back so many of these states', 'He’s got to win Florida', 'He’s got to win Ohio', 'Then he’s got to go and get the lead back in North Carolina and in Pennsylvania', 'His path is narrower because, as you said, Republicans don’t start with as large a base of electoral votes', 'So, he’s got to pull back some of those Democratic states', 'And the good news for him, though, is these states are not that dissimilar', 'If he can change people’s minds, you would probably start to see a sequence of states start to move, not just one or two', 'DICKERSON: All right', 'And you have added Arizona and Georgia to the mix, which are usually Republican states', 'That means a bigger map maybe for Hillary Clinton', 'We will see', 'Thanks, Anthony', 'We will be seeing a lot of you this fall', 'And we will continue to help inform our viewers about what is going on in the presidential race and out there in the battleground states', 'For now, we will take a pause', 'We will be back in a moment', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', 'DICKERSON: We have got a lot more ahead, but this programming note first', 'Be sure to tune in next week for our special coverage of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks', 'We will be talking to CIA Director John Brennan', 'We will be right back', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', 'DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now', 'But, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including an interview with former George W', 'Bush Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and our political panel', 'Stay with us', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', 'DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION', 'I’m John Dickerson', 'Joining us now is former attorney general Alberto Gonzales', 'He is out with new book', 'It’s called “True Faith and Allegiance,” a story of service and sacrifice in war and peace about his life and time serving the George W', 'Bush administration', 'Welcome', 'I want to start with the scene where you were briefly the one administration official to be off in a secret location', 'Tell us first a little bit about that experience', 'And then you said it gave you new appreciation for the presidency', 'How so', 'ALBERTO GONZALES, FORMER U', 'S', 'ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, of course, every year one cabinet official is asked to stay away --', 'DICKERSON: During the State of the Union', 'GONZALES: During the State of the Union in case there’s a disaster and someone in the line of presidential succession is still alive to become president of the United States', 'And in 2007, I was advised just days before the State of the Union that I would be that person', 'And so I spent that evening on an airplane flying around', 'And I remember thinking, watching President Bush give the address that evening, and I would -- and I’ve advise President Bush through something like 50 federal and state executions, through two wars', 'So I’ve experienced a pretty big -- big moments with him before', 'But sitting on that airplane, it suddenly hit me, oh, my gosh, if something happened in Washington, would I and the people on that airplane be -- be -- be able to govern a wounded nation', 'The president get -- finishes his speech', 'We’re ordered to go -- headed back to Andrews Air Force Base and we land and I -- I really had an appreciation of -- of the tremendous pressure and power the opportunity to be president of the United States was really kind of -- kind of special', 'DICKERSON: Yes', 'Well, we’re -- and we’re in the middle of a campaign where people are imaging the candidates stepping into that role --', 'GONZALES: Right', 'DICKERSON: That you stepped into for, you know, 45 minutes or however long the -- the speech was', 'You -- you’ve said that it takes a special kind of person to be president', 'GONZALES: Absolutely', 'DICKERSON: What do you mean by that', 'GONZALES: You know, looking at -- at -- at the president make decisions about who should go on the Supreme Court, or the decision to send men and women into battle, I think it takes someone with a great deal of integrity', 'And I can -- I think of very few jobs or vocations where integrity matters most', 'The American people want to know that the person, the most powerful person in the world, is constrained by the Constitution and not use that office for personal or political gain', 'It takes someone with wisdom', 'No one is born with wisdom', 'It comes from experience', 'So it’s a -- I think wisdom is very, very important', 'It also takes someone with vision, a positive vision for America', 'Someone who can say, come with me', 'I can take you to a better place', 'I think I’m -- American want to believe in someone who believes in them', 'And so -- and courage', 'You know, the -- the office is about decision making -- I heard President Bush say this often -- and you have to have the courage to make the tough decisions because at the end of the day, you know, that’s what the American people expect is -- is you to make the right decision, to be bold and address the problems of this country', 'DICKERSON: And so you’re a Republican', 'Does Donald Trump have those qualities you just outlined', 'GONZALES: Well, I’m still -- I’m still evaluating Donald --', 'DICKERSON: It’s been 15 months', 'What’s to evaluate', 'GONZALES: He’s -- well, because he shifts positions from time to time and, you know, I don’t -- I don’t know Donald Trump', 'I don’t think I’ve ever met Donald Trump', 'And so I think being able to -- to know someone takes some time', 'And -- and I -- I know there are lot of good people that I that I trust and know who are not supporting him and what it tells me is that I need to study this man very, very closely', 'I don’t think Americans should make a decision based upon the recommendations of anyone else', 'For example, if I today said, don’t -- I don’t support Donald Trump, or I do support Donald Trump, I -- I wouldn’t expect other Americans to -- to follow my lead', 'I would expect them to do their own investigation, evaluation as to whether or not this is the right person for them and their families and to lead this country', 'DICKERSON: Based on those criteria you outline and that you outline in the -- in the book, “True Faith and Allegiance', '”', 'Let me ask you another thing you said about Donald Trump’s comments about Mexico, because he went and made the trip this week', 'Donald Trump said, just to remind people, they bring drugs, they bring crime, they’re rapists', 'In response to that you said, “you can’t unring that bell', '” What does that mean', 'GONZALES: Well, I mean, there are consequences for words of -- when a president makes a statement', 'And I talk -- I talk about that in the book in terms of, once -- once the president makes -- makes a statement, it’s very, very difficult to walk that back', 'And so I think someone in the Oval Office has to be very careful about the words they say because they are -- there are consequences', 'And, quite frankly, there should be consequences', 'When the president draws a red line in the sand and says, if you go beyond that there will be consequences', 'There can be no doubt in any minds of our enemies that we -- that we intend to follow up and -- and that there will be consequences', 'So the words are very important from someone who sits in the Oval Office', 'DICKERSON: Let me ask you about an anecdote in the book that got a lot of attention at the time', 'It was March of 2004', 'John Ashcroft was the attorney general', 'You’re council to the president', 'There’s a scene in his hospital room --', 'GONZALES: Yes', 'DICKERSON: Where you’re trying to get an extension for the warrantless wiretapping program', 'GONZALES: Yes', 'DICKERSON: And there had been different stories told about this', 'Director Comey, now director of the FBI, says that you and Andy Card were there to try and, as he put it, take advantage of a very sick man', 'GONZALES: Right', 'DICKERSON: You tell your version of the story --', 'GONZALES: Yes', 'DICKERSON: Of what happened in the hospital room, trying to get that extension', 'What -- how did it go as you saw it', 'GONZALES: Well, you’re right, I did -- I spent some time in the book talking about this', 'And I’ll just say that I testified under oath about what happened in that hospital room', 'And the

The attorney general, John Ashcroft, who had just had surgery', 'GONZALES: John Ashcroft, who had just had surgery', 'And if he wasn’t competent, then we were not going to ask him to -- to do anything', 'We were primarily there to report on a leader -- on a meeting we had just had with congressional leaders about this very same program and about the -- about the dispute and the congressional leaders telling us we -- we believe it should go forward with the program', 'DICKERSON: Continue the program', 'GONZALES: Because it is so important in protecting American lives', 'And, of course, the very next day we had the Madrid train bombings', 'It was a very dangerous time for our country and we were trying to do what we could to insure that we had the tools necessary to protect America', 'DICKERSON: In terms of the warrantless wiretapping and then also enhanced interrogation, which you oversaw as -- as well', 'GONZALES: Well, I didn’t -- I didn’t oversee it', 'DICKERSON: But --', 'GONZALES: This was -- this --', 'DICKERSON: You advised on it as -- in your capacity with the president', 'GONZALES: Well, I was counsel to the president, but the advice came from the Department of Justice, the senior leadership at the department, and the lawyers within the administration saying, done a certain way, it would be effective, and it would -- and it would be lawful', 'DICKERSON: And I apologize', 'Not an unimportant fact', 'But how do you feel looking back on both of those things', 'Both of those policies have been changed', 'In the Republican race right now there are some -- well, Donald Trump is saying, bring back waterboarding', 'It would be great', 'What do you feel about that', 'GONZALES: I think we -- we should only be doing those things that are absolutely necessary and effective and lawful', 'And the question --', 'DICKERSON: Was that true of enhanced interrogation techniques', 'GONZALES: Absolutely', 'That it was effective and we’ve had testimony by -- by folks from the CIA and the FBI talking about information that we got from the program', 'And at that time, the Department of Justice issued an opinion that if -- if waterboarding, for example, was done under certain supervision, and it was only done to three people, high level detainees who we believe had information about a pending attack against the United States, that it would be lawful', 'And so this was, you know, obviously, very, very controversial', 'And I -- I don’t mean in this book to try to convince anyone who believes that waterboarding wasn’t torture that it wasn’t torture', 'I merely meant to point out that -- that the lawyers worked very, very hard to get this right, to -- to ensure that the -- that the CIA and the policymakers had the tools that they believe was necessary protect this country', 'DICKERSON: But just very briefly, parting shot -- question here', 'Your view now, if it were to come back, there’s a legal pathway to bring waterboarding back or is that closed', 'GONZALES: Would -- would I support it', 'I’d have to want to talk to the CIA folks to say, first of all, what is the threat', 'If, in fact, someone has information about a bomb that’s about to go off in Washington, D', 'C', ', in the next -- next half hour and we know some -- we have someone in custody that we know has information about that -- even Chuck Schumer said, in that kind of scenario, Senator Chuck Schumer from New York said, yes, he would authorize torture, assuming, again, I’m not suggest that it would be torture as a -- as a legal matter, but that would be a tool that I think we should pursue under those -- under certain kind of circumstances', 'DICKERSON: All right, Alberto Gonzales', 'The book is “True Faith and Allegiance', '” Thanks very much', 'GONZALES: Thanks, John', 'DICKERSON: We’ll be right back with our panel', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', 'DICKERSON: Joining us now for political analysis, Susan Page is “USA Today’s” Washington bureau chief, Jamelle Bouie is chief political correspondent for “Slate” magazine, and he’s a CBS News political analyst, Molly Ball covers politics for “The Atlantic,” and Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor at “The National Review” and a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute', 'Ramesh, I want to start with you', 'At the end of the week, Donald Trump has been to Mexico, met with the Mexican president', 'He also gave a zesty speech in Arizona in the same day', 'Do the calculation', 'Where do things stand at the end of the week with Donald Trump and immigration', 'RAMESH PONNURU, “THE NATIONAL REVIEW”: Well, I think that it is a confusing story', 'Today, on the airwaves, Trump supporters Chris Christie on this show and Rudy Giuliani are saying, he has softened on immigration, he’s no long for mass deportation, and this story is not getting through', 'Well, one of the reasons it’s not getting through is that Trump didn’t actually say that mass deportation is not on the table any more', 'He simply implied it', 'And he did it in a speech that was -- that was all of the -- all of the atmospherics of it were extremely hard line', 'It’s a speech that actually reads differently than it looks', 'And I don’t see how the -- the Trump campaign expects that it is going to get credit for softening, which it clearly wants, if it won’t actually come out and make that message more explicit', 'DICKERSON: Molly, I was surprised that Chris Christie used the word “pause', '” I mean Donald Trump, during the primary, said the undocumented immigrants in America will be out so fast your head will spin', 'That is very different than the word “pause', '”', 'MOLLY BALL, “THE ATLANTIC”: It is', 'Look, there’s been a lot of attempts to muddy the water, but I really think that a decision was made when Trump gave that immigration speech that he cannot walk back', 'And as Ramesh was saying, the decision was made to cast this issue in very harsh terms, to continue to depict illegal immigrants as criminals and as a danger to this country', 'And so whatever policy is in the fine print, and I don’t think we will ever know that because he’s taken all of the positions at once in a way, but the tone of that speech, I think, really closed a door for Trump with some voters who were looking for him to be more compassionate, to strike a tone more of acceptance, no matter what policy he’s advocating, I think, with certain Hispanic voters and certain non-Hispanic voters, there might have been an open door and that door was closed by the decision that Trump made to give that speech', 'DICKERSON: Jamelle, who are those voters that -- that he’s trying to -- Donald Trump’s trying to appeal to with this softening, whatever we want to call it, if -- whether it exists or doesn’t exist', 'JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it’s whatever percentage of voters, Republican voters, that are staying away from states like Arizona and Georgia and North Carolina', 'North Carolina, Mitt Romney won that by a slim margin in 2012', 'And it’s pretty much a must win state for Donald Trump', 'And I think that margin is mostly the result of Republican voters who were just staying away', 'And you have all these activated, energized Democratic voters who are sort of taking their place', 'So as long as Trump is losing that group, which is college educated, which is suburban, which is predominants (ph) in states like Virginia, Colorado, is important in Pennsylvania, as long as Trump is losing that group of voters, then his path to 270 electoral votes is very narrow, if increasingly nonexistent', 'SUSAN PAGE, “USA TODAY”: You know it’s interesting, if you look at most of the demographic groups, they are pretty stable from four years ago', 'And the one exception are college educated whites', 'DICKERSON: Right', 'PAGE: In the exit polls in 2012, college educated whites went Republican by 14 percentage points', 'And in the last Pew Research Center poll, which is a big respected poll, they went for Hillary Clinton by 14 percentage points', 'That is the kind of swing that I don’t think we’ve seen before with a big group in American politics since we started polling in the 1950s', 'DICKERSON: Meaning she’s up by 14 there', 'PAGE: He’s up by 14, whereas Barack Obama lost them by 14 points just four years ago', 'Think of what -- a big swing that is among college educated whites', 'A huge part of the U', 'S', 'population, a huge part of the electorate in just four years', 'I was talking to political scientist this week -- this week, Alan Abramowitz (ph) at Emery, who spends a lot of time looking at these questions', 'We couldn’t come up with another example of that kind of swing since 1952 when we started to be able to look by the -- at the demographics of presidential elections', 'BALL: Well, and the gamble of the Trump campaign is that he is realigning the electorate to make up for that swing by attracting more non-college educated white voters and a lot of Democrats', 'But we haven’t seen him do that', 'BOUIE: Right', 'PONNURU: Yes', 'BALL: What -- as you say, all the other groups are stable', 'PONNURU: You mention Abramowitz', 'He has a model of election returns that predicts, based on the economy, based on these variables, Trump should win, Clinton should lose, but he doesn’t actually think that’s going to happen because Trump has run such a different kind of campaign that has scrambled the electorate in that way', 'DICKERSON: Jamelle, do you think, going back to this point that Molly was making about realigning the electorate, if that’s your take, then wouldn’t you not need to do the softening, because you’re realigning', 'Is -- in other words, do you see in the softening undermining this notion that there’s a huge group of people out there', 'BOUIE: Right', 'I mean a softening I think is de facto evidence if this group of people isn’t there or if it’s not -- it’s not large enough to make up for the voters you’re losing', 'I think the original theory was that Trump could have this hard line message and begin to pull non-college educated whites and specifically non-college educated white men from Democrats, those who aren’t voting, pull them into the electorate', 'But what’s happened is basically, yes, you have this action, reactivating a bunch of these voters, but you have a reaction, too, from college educated whites, from African-Americans, from Latinos, and the reaction is essentially overwhelming the action', 'And Trump -- the Trump campaign is now trying to figure out how it can mitigate the reaction, but I just don’t think it has time to do so at this point', 'DICKERSON: Is this, Molly, what you saw in this visit to the Detroit church, this is also a part of this effort and where do we think that -- is it going to be successful, meaningful', 'Is it all about -- it is about African-Americans or is it about this group of college educated voters that we’ve been talking about', 'BALL: If there is a political calculation, and I think that’s always an if with Trump and his campaign because so much of it is so improvisational and sort of based on the gut', 'But if there is a calculation, it probably is much more about those white swing voters', 'On the other hand, you know, you see him getting zero or one or two percent of the African-American vote in these polls', 'There may literally be nowhere to go but up for Donald Trump', 'And those images where he at least seems to be making contact and listening to African- Americans could give him some lift there', 'But it does seem to be mostly about the predominantly white portion of the electorate that looks at him and believes that he’s a racist, that he’s intolerant, that he’s hateful and wants to be reassured', 'They -- they -- these people want to vote for the Republican', 'BOUIE: Right', 'BALL: They want to vote for the person with the “R” next to his name, and that’s why, I think, Trump still has some upside, but he needs to convince them that they -- that they can do that', 'BOUIE: And there’s some -- there’s some good political science that notes that part of the gender gap in presidential election is essentially a function of white racial views', 'That women tend to have softer and less conservative racial views than men do', 'And when they see candidates who are hard line or seemingly hard line on racial issues, they react very negatively', 'And so George W', 'Bush, for example, did better than you would expect among white college educated women, in part because his brand, as it were, was a Republican with more liberal racial views you’re your typical Republican', 'DICKERSON: Ramesh, let me ask you a question about how to fix this brand issue, because you can’t do it in one event and yet when Donald Trump went to meet with the president of Mexico, the word “presidential” got thrown around a lot', 'I’m going to apply to the wisdom of the group here', 'What does it mean to be presidential in a campaign context', 'What’s the real benefit of presidential', 'PONNURU: If you look at the breakdown in that North Carolina poll from CBS, a majority of North Carolina voters don’t believe that Donald Trump is ready to be commander in chief', 'That is what it means', 'That is, I think, the central problem of this candidacy', 'People dislike him', 'People dislike her', 'But they think she is ready to be commander in chief', 'They don’t believe that he is', 'That I think is when we’re talking about presidential, when we’re talking about gravitas, changing his image, that’s the key thing he has to do', 'DICKERSON: And can you do it, though, Susan, in who -- you’ve been to many of those -- those kinds of presidential moments, but can you do it in a -- just standing up there and -- and having a -- the image', 'Is that good enough', 'PAGE: Well, I think that, and combined with the good performance in debates, is probably good enough, because you, in fact, have an electorate that wants to vote against Hillary Clinton --', 'DICKERSON: Yes', 'PAGE: Because they don’t think she’s honest and trustworthy, because they’re ready for change after eight years of a Democratic administration', 'But Donald Trump, at least so far, has not gotten over the hurdle of looking like you can trust him to be commander in chief', 'That doesn’t -- I say -- I don’t think you could say there was no time left for him to do this because despite all the disadvantages that we’ve talked about so far for Donald Trump, he’s still within striking distance', 'In your national poll -- two points in your battleground states poll', 'That, you know -- and we’ve got, what, 65 days left', 'DICKERSON: Right', 'Right', 'Well, you’ve given us a segue to talk about Hillary Clinton', 'Jamelle, new information about her FBI interview', 'The numbers are very soft', 'In some polls they’re coming down', 'What is the state of Hillary Clinton’s campaign and -- I mean it’s now been several weeks that this comes up', 'BOUIE: Right', 'DICKERSON: It’s a bruise that keeps getting hit', 'BOUIE: I pretty much think at this point you can tie Hillary Clinton’s fortunes and national polls to the tenor of her news coverage', 'When news coverage of Clinton is good or neutral, like just after the Democratic Convention, her poll numbers basically hit your 48, your 49 percent level, and she ends up establishing a seven or eight point lead over Trump', 'When the e-mails come in, when the foundation comes in, when these questions that remind people of all the things that they do not like about Hillary Clinton, that they do not like about the broader political world come in, her numbers immediately soften to 45, 44', 'And that’s basically been the story going back to even, you know, April and May', 'Her lead after the convention was very similar to her lead right at that time', 'The difference -- well, not the difference, but the same pattern happen', 'In April and May you had conversation about her e-mails and the foundation and her speeches and Bernie’s attacks, and it softened her to 44, 45', 'And I think it sort of -- it’s almost like a timing game that we’ll just see come November where she is in this cycle', 'DICKERSON: Ramesh, did you take anything away from those FBI reports that is new or it just sort of the general issue that she has on this that will be with her all the way through to November', 'PONNURU: There’s always another piece of evidence that tends to reinforce the public’s view that there is a lack of transparency, a lack of honesty, forthcomingness from Hillary Clinton', 'And I don’t think that story is about Clinton aides destroying phones with hammers is going to help her in any way', 'I -- I talked to a Republicans about this, a Republican strategists, who said, well, at least somebody’s keeping this race competitive', 'DICKERSON: Molly', 'PAGE: And yet a -- yet a big potential scandal involving Donald Trump, and I was glad you asked Chris Christie about it because I’m surprised it hasn’t gotten more attention, which is that Donald trump, in 2013, his foundation made an illegal $25,000 contribution to a campaign committee associated with the Florida attorney general, who was, at that time, deciding whether to pursue an investigation into Trump University', 'And this is the kind of thing -- he’s now paid a fine, which is -- as “The Washington Post” has reported', 'This is -- this should be a major story', 'And I’m perplexed by why it hasn’t gotten more attention', 'I think one reason is, there’s so much attention to her scandals and her credibility to make attacks on the -- on the front of honesty and trustworthiness are so low that it’s harder to get -- for her to generate outrage about this potential scandal involving him', 'DICKERSON: Well, and also Donald --', 'PONNURU: It’s a good news cycles of the third party candidates, I think', 'DICKERSON: Right', 'Well, Donald Trump has also boasted about being able to do precisely that, give donations to get what he wants', 'I mean he hasn’t been shy about this', 'He hasn’t spoken directly to that thing, but he has said, that’s why the system’s so corrupt because I was a master at playing it', 'PAGE: Yes', 'DICKERSON: Molly, let me ask you about on Hillary Clinton', 'When she speaks, is that good for her campaign or bad no matter what the topic', 'BALL: I think it depends', 'I -- I don’t think it is the case that every time she opened her mouth she makes things worse', 'And I -- she would hold a press conference, I think that whether or not she got herself into further trouble with her answers to questions, it would be refreshing to see her facing the press and answering questions', 'And, you know, she’s playing a very conventional campaign strategy where you spend your August fundraiser, and then you assume that the campaign engages in full after Labor Day', 'So I think we -- it’s safe to assume that we will see more of her doing public events and giving speeches after Labor Day', 'DICKERSON: Jamelle, there -- she’s likely to give more policy speeches', 'Is that a way to beat back the criticism that she’s kind of disappeared during August --', 'BOUIE: Right', 'DICKERSON: Raise a lot of money while she disappeared', 'But is that a way out of the fix she faces', 'BOUIE: I’m not entirely sure because I think when it comes to Hillary Clinton’s public perception, people kind of just think that she -- she knows a lot, that she’s very prepared with regards to the policy', 'The things that people do not like or cannot believe about Hillary Clinton, they do not like that she’s secretive', 'They do not believe that she cares about people like them', 'And I’m not sure if more policy speeches will fix that latter problem', 'I don’t know if she needs to fix the former problem', 'Bill Clinton never ever really quite fixed the former problem about his trustworthiness, but he was able to convince people that he cared about them', 'And I think that’s Clinton’s challenge going forward', 'DICKERSON: And it may be impossible to fix the first, the cares about you', 'She could, presumably, if she

doctors objected to removing her from their care, they had “numerous” weapons pointed at them—after which Hillary Clinton was taken from this medical facility by her just arrived motorcade', 'With this potentially deadly situation being observed by many people, this report says, a number of them alerted Joint Base Andrews security police who put the entire base on lockdown—but was later

problems because they are overextended, don’t have a clear sense of what is their core interests, and what are things that they’ve liked to help, and the key in Syria at this point is, unless we can get the parties involved to recognize that they are just burning their country to the ground, and get it on a diplomatic and political track, frankly, there’s going to be a limit to what we can do',

there has been a substantial increase in terror attacks around the world', 'Likewise, here in the U', 'S', ', we’ve had major attacks in large cities such as Orlando, New York City, and elsewhere', 'Sir, my question to you, are we doing anything now greater to combat Islamic jihadists', 'OBAMA: Well, I think that — first of all, it’s important to recognize that if you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents has not substantially increased', 'What we’ve seen are some very high profile attacks, mostly in the Middle East, also in our European theaters', 'ISIL’s emergence, obviously, has underscored the fact that even after we killed Bin Laden, even after we dismantled al-Qaeda, which was the primary threat when I came into office, that the ideology of hatred and killing had metastasized', 'And we’ve now seen a number of incidents here in the homeland, but they’re different in kind from the sorts of attacks that we saw on 9/11', 'Part of what has happened is because of the outstanding work of our men and women in uniform, and us dismantling al-Qaeda, partly because of hardening the homeland, the incredible ramp up of intelligence work that we do, the much more effective cooperation between law enforcement and the military so that information sharing, for example, between the FBI and cities and law enforcement officials there has much improved, because of the improvements we’ve made on aviation, it is much harder for terrorist organizations to carry out large scale attacks', 'The challenge we have, and this is going to be a challenge that we have for a while, is that it is possible for individuals or small groups of people to be inspired, and if they’re willing to die to carry out significant harm, even though they’re not directed from the outside, even though there’s not a complicated plot, and these so-called lone wolf terrorist actors are going to be our biggest danger because they’re the most difficult to see coming, and that’s why our goal right now is, dismantling ISIL will reduce the appeal of what they’re broadcasting through the internet, the poison that they’re feeding people oftentimes who may have other mental illnesses or be troubled in some way', 'But you take an example like the situation in Orlando', 'You have an individual here who has not broken any laws, who, because of the way we organize our ability to purchase firearms, can go into a store legally, buy a bunch of firearms, and if he goes into a club and decides he wants to shoot a lot of folks, he can do a lot of damage', 'And so part of what we’re having to do is to, even as we go after ISIL and dismantle them, we’re also going to have to work to figure out, how do we block or counteract some of the hateful ideology that’s coming over the internet, and we’re also going to have to take some common sense precautions about how people who may have been inspired by these jihadists are able to get firearms, for example, and go into a club or into a mall and start shooting people up', 'And that’s going to be a challenge', 'But I do think it’s important for us to maintain perspective here', 'The work that this military has done and the work that our law enforcement has done has made us significantly safer today than we were when 9/11 happened', 'TAPPER: Thank you, Major', 'I want to introduce you to Donna Coates', 'She’s the widow of army veteran Barry Coates', 'He waited more than a year for a colonoscopy at a VA hospital', 'By the time he got one, it revealed terminal cancer that had metastasized', 'The family sued the VA', 'That claim was settled', 'Donna —', 'DONNA COATES, WIDOW OF ARMY VETERAN: Mr', 'President, I stand before you today with my hopes (inaudible) was always his desire to meet you, and sadly he never got a chance', 'However, two years ago, (inaudible) testified in front of Congress, and we heard a lot of promises about reforms in accountability, but still, nothing has changed', 'In fact, the contracted doctor that misdiagnosed my husband is still treating our veterans at the same VA clinic', 'My mamma’s always told me that if you stop talking about stuff and do it, then you don’t have to talk about it any longer', 'So when are we going to actually start holding these contracted doctors and the VA employees accountable', 'For it’s a difference between life and death', 'And families like mine, they’re tired of waiting', 'And the only true change that’s come since we began talking was that I am now a widow', 'And my family, we will never be the same', 'OBAMA: Well first of all, my heart goes out to you', 'I heard the testimony of your husband', 'Bob McDonald, the head of the VA, heard that testimony, and because we can’t bring your husband back, I don’t want to in any way sugar coat the fact that there have been significant problems in the VA that have accumulated over decades', 'And the incidents that we saw in South Carolina, the incidents that we saw in Phoenix, I think were inexcusable, but they were also an indication that you have a system, a bureaucracy that had gotten overwhelmed, built up over time', 'And now when you have a lot more veterans coming home, needing treatment, even with some of the improvements that were made, there were still inexcusable wait times', 'Now, we have actually made progress', 'And again, I don’t want to in any way pretend that we’re where we need to be', 'But we have in fact fired a whole bunch of people who were in charge of some of these facilities', 'I don’t know the particular case of this individual doctor, but you can bet, I’ll find out after this meeting', 'We now have a situation where about 80 percent of individuals who interact with the VA are satisfied that they’re getting timely treatment', 'I want that to be 100 percent, and that requires more work', 'Since I came into office, just to give you some sense of perspective, we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent', 'No president has increased the VA budget faster and more aggressively than I have because I believe that we’ve got to meet the sacred vow that we make to our troops that, if you are fighting for us, when you come home, you’re going to get good service', 'But it’s not enough just for us to put more money into the system if the system itself is dysfunctional', 'So part of what was happening, and we’re beginning to fix it, but we’re not there yet, is, in taking appointments, we were using old systems where somebody would answer the phone, they’d write down, try to schedule it, then they’d hand it off to somebody who then would input it into some old, rickety computer, and then somebody would print it out and it would get passed on to somebody else, and, so the system itself was so antiquated, so old, that it was hugely inefficient', 'So we’re having to rebuild information systems, intake systems — part of what we’ve done, working with Congress, was also making sure that if somebody is in a situation where, for example, they live far away from a facility, that they now have recourse to go to a private doctor, and to get, that doctor can get reimbursed', 'So across the board, we’re working on these issues', 'But I think it’s really important to understand that the VA schedules 58 million appointments every year', '58 million', 'And I want zero errors in all that process', 'We’re not anywhere near zero errors, and sadly, there are real consequences for people when that happens', 'But I don’t want you to ever think that it’s because people like Bob McDonald, his deputies, are not taking this very seriously, because we understand this is a life or death situation, and we are resourcing it, but the VA is a big ocean liner, like a lot of the federal government, and when you initiate changes, you’re trying to steer it, maybe you get it over on the right course, but you’re not going to see fully the impact of all the changes we’re making until a few years out', 'But I appreciate you sharing what I know is a heartbreaking situation', 'I promise you, it’s not something that we ever stop thinking about', 'TAPPER: Thank you so much', 'This is First Lieutenant James Sutter', 'He’s an executive officer here in Fort Lee', 'He serves in a mortuary affairs company', 'FIRST LIEUTENANT JAMES SUTTER: Mr', 'President, we honor those who have given deep meaning to the phrase, home of the

before, I believe that us honoring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation', 'And I think that for me, for my family, for those who work in the White House, we recognize

respect people’s rights to have a different opinion and to make different decisions about how they want to express their concerns', 'And the test of our fidelity to our constitution, the freedom of speech, to our bill of rights, is not when it’s easy, but when it’s hard', 'We fight sometimes so that people can do things that we disagree with', 'But that’s what freedom means in this country',

'But as long as they’re doing it within the law, then we can voice our opinion objecting to it, but it’s also their right', 'And I think that it’s also important for us to recognize that sometimes out of these controversies, we start getting into a conversation, and I want everybody to listen to each other', 'So I want Mr', 'Kaepernick and others who are on a knee, I want them to listen to the pain that that may cause somebody who, for example, had a spouse or a child who was killed in combat, and why it hurts them to see somebody not standing', 'But I also want people to think about the pain that he may be expressing about somebody who’s lost a loved one that they think was unfairly shot', 'And one of the things that I always say about American democracy is, it can be frustrating, but

obviously, for his service', 'I spent a lot of time with gold star moms, as does Michelle, and it’s always one of the most profound things we do in office, is just spending time with families and hearing about not just the sacrifices, but also the incredible life and patriotism and talent that these men and women live their lives with', 'The truth of the matter is that this is an issue that has been sort of manufactured, because there is no doubt, and I’ve said repeatedly that where we see terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda or ISIL, they have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse, for basically barbarism and death', 'These are people who kill children, kill Muslims, take sex slaves — there’s no religious rationale that would justify in any way any of the things that they do', 'But what I have been careful about when I describe these issues is to make sure that we do not lump these murderers into the billion Muslims that exist around the world, including in this country, who are peaceful, who are responsible, who in this country, are our fellow troops and police officers and firefighters and teachers and neighbors and friends', 'And what I learned from listening to some of these Muslim families both in the United States and overseas is that when you start calling these organizations Islamic terrorists, the way it’s heard, the way it’s received by our friends and allies around the world is that somehow Islam is terroristic', 'And that then makes them feel as if they’re under attack', 'In some cases, it makes it harder for us to get their cooperation in fighting terrorism', 'So do I think that if somebody uses the phrase Islamic terrorism that it’s a huge deal', 'No', 'There’s no doubt that these folks think that — and claim that they’re speaking for Islam', 'But I don’t want to validate what they do', 'I don’t want to — if — if you had a — an organization that was going around killing and blowing people up and said we’re on the vanguard of Christianity, well, I’m not — as a Christian, I’m not going to let them claim my religion and say you’re killing for Christ', 'I would — I would say that’s ridiculous', 'That’s not what my religion stands for', 'Call these folks what they are, which is killers and terrorists', 'And — and that’s what we’ve been trying to do, is to make sure that A, we don’t validate their claims that somehow they speak for Islam, because they don’t', 'And, B, making sure that we do not, uh, make Muslims who are well-meaning and our natural allies on this fight, because these groups are killing more Muslims than they’re killing anybody else, make sure that they don’t feel as if somehow the — this is some contest between the West and Islam', 'And, you know, I think that — I’ll just be honest with you, the dangers where we get loose in this language, particularly when a president or people aspiring to get pres — become president get loose with this language, you can — you can see in some of the language that we use — in talking about Muslim-Americans here and the notion that somehow we’d start having religious tests in — in who can come in the country and who’s investigated and — and — and whether “The Bill of Rights” applies to them in the same way', 'And that’s a slippery slope', 'And — and — and the way we’re going to win this battle is not by betraying our ideals, it’s by making sure that we hold true to our ideals and one of our core ideals is — is that, you know, if you’re an American and you are, you know, subscribing to the ideals and the creed and the values that we believe in as a country, you know, then we don’t have a religious test in this country', 'TAPPER: Just to interject…', 'OBAMA: Yes', 'TAPPER: — you were clearly talking about the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, just then', 'You think his…', 'OBAMA: No, I wasn’t', 'But…', 'TAPPER: You weren’t', 'OBAMA: — I — because — no, I — I…', 'TAPPER: Well, you just said…', 'OBAMA: — I would just say this, Jake, because…', 'TAPPER: — aspiring to this office…', 'OBAMA: — no, but it’s not — it’s not — it’s not unique to the Republican nominee', 'And — and, again, I’m I’m trying to be careful', 'We’re on a military base', 'I don’t want to — I don’t want to insert partisan politics into this', 'I think that there have been a number of public figures where you start hearing commentary that is dangerous because what it starts doing is it starts dividing us up as Americans', 'When I go to Arlington Cemetery, mostly I see crosses', 'Sometimes I see stars of David', 'And sometimes I see Islamic crescents', 'And those families are just as proud regardless of their religion that — that, um, a member of their family who they love just as much as anybody sacrificed for this country', 'And I want to make sure that we, as a nation, stay unified because that’s how we’re going to achieve our missions', 'TAPPER: The role of women in combat, not in the military, but specifically in combat…', 'OBAMA: Right', 'TAPPER: — has been a big one during your presidency', 'Our next question comes from Captain Lauren Serrano, who’s an active duty Marine', 'She earned a Bronze star for her service in Iraq and has a question on that subject', 'CAPTAIN LAUREN SERRANO: Good afternoon, Mr', 'President', 'A study by the Marine Corps revealed that mixed gender combat units performed notably worse and that women suffered staggeringly higher rates of injury', 'Just one of those statistics showed that mixed gender units took up to 159 percent longer to evacuate a casualty than all-male units', 'As the wife of a Marine who deploys to combat often, that added time can mean the difference between my husband living or dying', 'Why were these tangible negative consequences disregarded and how does the integration of women positively enhance the infantry mission and make me and my husband safer', 'OBAMA: I don’t think any of — any studies are going to be disregarded', 'I think that what we have to do is to take a look at the particular deployments, the particular situations', 'There are going to be situations in which women are on the front lines', 'And they’re doing a bunch of stuff now', 'We — sometimes we can call them combat or not, but the truth of the matter is they’re in war theater and they are at great risk', 'There are going to be other situations in which the commanders in the field have to make decisions about what’s going to be best in order for us to accomplish the mission', 'But the one thing that I do know is that as a consequence of women serving in our military and opening up what used to be closed situations to them, we’ve gained a lot of talent', 'We’ve gained a lot of incredible soldiers, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen', 'And it is — I want to make sure that our starting assumption is if you can do the job, you should be able to get the job', 'Now, if you can’t do the job, if there is a problem with performance, then that has to be taken into account', 'But keep in mind that there are a lot of jobs that are considered combat that don’t necessarily involve you being on the front lines going door-to-door in Fallujah', 'And part of the — the task of the Joint Chiefs and the secretary of Defense and others is making those determinations and not just simply painting a broad brush and saying, you know what, women can’t be in combat, because there may be situations in which they could do the best job', 'It may not involve physical strength or how many pull-ups you can do, it may involve the precision with which you can operate and you being able to keep your cool you being able to carry out a task with a low error rate', 'And it may be that in those situations, a woman can perform better than a man', 'So what I would — my instructions to the secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs is not to engage in political correctness', 'This isn’t some symbolic issue', 'This is let’s make sure that we’re not fielding half a team if we’ve got a whole team', 'Let’s figure out who can do what and who can do it best', 'And if they can do it best, I want to make sure they’ve got opportunities', 'I don’t want the presumption to be that a woman can’t do the job, because I’m looking at you right now and I’m pretty sure that you’re in better shape than I am and you can do a lot of stuff I couldn’t do', 'And I don’t want you not to have that opportunity', 'I agree with you that we can’t just out of some ideological notion make it more dangerous for your husband', 'But I don’t want to — I don’t want a military, an institution that starts with the premise that women can’t do something', 'If it turns out they can’t do something, then we’ll deal with that specific situation', 'But I don’t want to start off with that assumption', 'TAPPER: Thank you, Captain', 'We’re going to take a very quick break', 'Our town hall conversation, America’s Military and the Commander-In-Chief continues right after this', '(COMMERCIAL BREAK)', '(APPLAUSE)', 'TAPPER: Welcome back', 'We’re at the Fort Lee Army Post in Virginia continuing with our CNN town hall with President Barack Obama and members of our armed services', 'Before we continue, Mr', 'President, there are a few people in the audience I just want to point out to you for particular recognition', 'And first, we’ll start with the — the two oldest veterans here, Colonel Porture L', 'Taylor (ph), who’s right there', 'He’s 91, a veteran of World War II, Korea and Vietnam', 'In both the Army and the Navy', 'And then we are…', '(APPLAUSE)', 'TAPPER: To my left, we have Staff Sergeant Millie Dunveazy (ph), who served in the Women’s Army Corps during World War II', 'She is, believe it or not, 98 years old', 'OBAMA: I don’t believe it', 'TAPPER: No, I don’t believe it, either', '(APPLAUSE)', 'OBAMA: I don’t believe it', '(APPLAUSE)', 'TAPPER: You recognized already retired Army Captain Floren Groberg (ph), who tackled a suicide bomber in Afghanistan, sustained serious injuries but saved many lives', 'He received a Medal of Honor from you last year, Mr', 'President, for his bravery', 'And we’ll honor him right now', '(APPLAUSE)', 'TAPPER: And then, of course, I’d be remiss if I didn’t thank our host', 'We have Major General Darrell K', 'Williams', 'He’s the commanding general of the U', 'S', 'Army Combined Armed Support Command in Fort Lee', 'For those of you watching at home, this is the guy in charge', 'Thank you so much for your hospitality', '(APPLAUSE)', 'TAPPER: I want to get back to the men and women, but I have one quick question for you', 'Congress has done something today that they have never done to you before', 'You vetoed a bill that would have allowed 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia', 'They, today, overrode your veto', 'That has never happened to you before', 'OBAMA: Right', 'TAPPER: Your reaction', 'OBAMA: Well, I think it was a mistake', 'And I understand why it happened', 'Obviously, all of us still carry the scars and trauma of 9/11', 'Nobody more than this 9/11 generation that’s fought on our behalf in the aftermath of of 9/11', 'And, you know, those families deserve support and they deserve resources', 'That’s why we set up a victims compensation fund', 'And on average, the families receive about $2 million each', 'But what this legislation did was it said if a private citizen believes that having been victimized by terrorism that another country didn’t do enough to stop one of its citizens, for example, in engaging in terrorism, then they can file a personal lawsuit, a private lawsuit in court', 'And the problem with that is that if we eliminate this notion of sovereign immunity, then our men and women in uniform around the world could potentially start seeing ourselves subject to reciprocal loss, right', 'So if you have a situation where we’re doing disaster relief in the Philippines or some other — or Haiti, and a traffic accident happens where, tragically, a citizen of that country is killed, if they passed the same kind of legislation that we just passed, now, potentially, that family in that country could start suing the United States', 'They might say we’re going to take jurisdiction over that individual', 'And we’ve set up what are called status of forces agreements so that when we deploy, our people are not vulnerable to these kinds of private lawsuits', 'And other countries agree to do that but mainly because we reciprocate with them', 'And the concern that I’ve had is — has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia per se or my sympathy for 9/11 families, it has to do with me not wanting a situation in which we’re suddenly exposed to liabilities for all the work that we’re doing all around the world, and suddenly finding ourselves subject to the — the private lawsuits in courts where we don’t even know exactly whether they’re on the up and up, in some cases', 'So — so this is a — it’s a — it’s a dangerous precedent and it’s an example of why sometimes you have to do what’s hard', 'And, frankly, I wish Congress here had done what’s hard', 'I didn’t expect it, because voting — if you’re perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election, not surprisingly, that’s a hard vote for people to take', 'But it would have been the right thing to do', 'And I am — I’m concerned — and this is not just my concern', 'General Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said this is a bad idea', 'The secretary of Defense said it was a bad idea', 'And then we found out some of the people who voted for it said, frankly, we didn’t know what was in it', 'And there was no debate of it', 'And it was, you know, basically a political vote', 'I — I understand that', 'But, you know, my job as commander-in-chief is to make sure that we’re looking ahead at how this is going to impact our overall mission, because what this also means is this time it’s Saudi Arabia, but let’s say that there’s a terrorist who comes here from Great Britain, our closest ally', 'We do all kinds of work with them to prevent terrorism', 'But they’ve got some people like the radicals who are living in our country who may be British citizens', 'They come here, they carry out something', 'Now, under this legislation, somebody who had been harmed by that terrorist could sue the British government and start asking for all kinds of documents and sending in a bunch of trial lawyers and — and, by the way, the last point I’d make, if we know that a country was helping a terrorist, then we’d call them a state sponsor of terrorism', 'And they don’t have immunity and you can sue them anyway', 'But that’s a judgment that we make based on the intelligence that we have, based on our military assessment and in this situation, we did not make such an assessment, that Saudi Arabia was as state sponsor of terrorism', 'This is taking that out of our military and our intelligence and the hands of our national security professionals and putting it into the courts', 'And that’s a mistake', 'TAPPER: Let’s get back to the men and women here', 'You might also recognize Marine Corporal Brandon Rumbaugh', 'During his second deployment to Afghanistan, he lost both of his legs in an IED blast while carrying a stretcher to help his friends, who had been injured in an earlier explosion', 'Sir', 'CORPORAL BRANDON RUMBAUGH: First, I want to start by thanking you for being here today to address, you know, some of the needs of our veterans all over the country', 'And second, for, you know, the numerous times you specifically checked on me during my recovery at Walter Reed', 'But my question, it regards a very small percentage of this country, the — the 1 percent that — that serves this country', 'OBAMA: Right', 'RUMBAUGH: We have men and women that serve in combat theaters four, five, even six times in such small amount of time', 'What can we do to take the burden off of these service members and also, at the same time, increase the number of citizens that serve our country', 'OBAMA: Well, first of all, it’s good — it’s great to see you', 'Each time I see him, his arms are a little bigger', 'Those are some guns, man', 'RUMBAUGH: Thank you', 'OBAMA: And — and, you know, it’s just one of the — one of the things that has been most satisfying as — as president and commander-in-chief is just getting to know folks like Brendan and their heroism and courage', 'But, also the people who help them along the way', 'You know, the folks at Walter Reed, the folks at Belvoir and other facilities around the world', 'It’s just incredible what they’re doing in terms of helping folks heal and the next thing you know they’re running races and, you know, doing all kinds of stuff can’t do', 'So I’m — I’m really proud of you', 'You’re raising a really interesting question', 'One — one of the challenges we have is we — we’ve got the best all-volunteer army in history', 'I mean the fact is, people step up to serve, they want to serve and that means, you know, we — we are able to get the best of the best and people are enthusiastic and patriotic and that’s why our force, I believe, is at its peak', 'I mean the — our military personnel are unbelievable across the services', 'But what does happen is because our all-volunteer army is so good, you start getting like a — a professional warrior class of 1 percent and then you get 99 percent who, you know, will salute and, you know, cheer at a ball game and, you know, will honor our veterans on Veterans Day, but beyond that, don’t really have that much of a stake', 'And that is dangerous, because, what happens then is it’s very easy, for example, to say, well, let’s just go send some more troops in to solve this problem or that problem because those folks aren’t directly affected, just a small number are', 'I would like to see more of our young men and women serve including people who are, you know, underrepresented right now', 'And a lot of those are folks who are from higher income brackets, you know', 'I — I’d like to see a situation in which we’re more actively recruiting and lifting up the need for all of us to serve in some ways', 'There may be ways in which we can modify our recruitment efforts so that we’re casting a wider net', 'I do think that the heroism of the 9/11 generation and the — the genuine honor of the people are showing, of men and women in uniform today, which is different than it was in Vietnam', 'Hopefully, will attract more people to an interest in serving', 'But it — if you’re not serving directly in our military, at minimum, you can join the kinds of efforts like Michelle has talked about with Joining Forces, where your company can hire more veterans, your community can do more to actively provide services to veterans', 'You can volunteer for — with one of the amazing VSOs to help a wounded warrior who’s getting back on their feet', 'You know, if you’ve got a — a movie theater, you can provide discounts to folks who are coming back, right', 'So there’s a lot of ways that people can serve even if they’re not directly in uniform and — and I want to give a shout-out to Michelle and Jill — Dr', 'Jill Biden because they’re Joining Forces program has resulted in about 1', '2 million members of our military and spouses getting training, employment opportunities and other benefits from the private sector that previously had not been involved', 'So we’ve got to do a better job at showing them how they can help', 'And I think people will be willing to help', 'TAPPER: Thank you so much', 'Appreciate it', 'Let’s bring in Amanda Souza', 'She’s a Gold Star wife and a Blue Star mom', 'Her husband was a 25-year veteran who suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress and committed suicide last year', 'She created a foundation in his honor to help other veterans, service men and women, and their families improve their lives', 'Her son is an active duty Marine', 'Amanda', 'AMANDA SOUZA: Good afternoon, Mr', 'President', 'Thank you for being here', 'Throughout my husband’s military career, he spent a lot of time overseas, many, many deployments and very, very dangerous missions', 'Unfortunately on his last deployment, they were under enemy attack and not everyone made it', 'The things that may husband had to go through, he had to live with after he came home', 'He was diagnosed with PTSD, but unfortunately, like many of our service men and women, this was his career, this was his livelihood and he was too scared to go get help because he did not want to risk being labeled as unstable or weak', 'Unfortunately, he did not get the help that he needed', 'He had a family to support and he ended up joining the ranks of the on average 22 veterans a day that commit suicide', 'My question to you is how can we ensure that our military men and women understand that it’s OK to get the help that they need and that they’re not going to risk their careers, that they are not going to be labeled', 'How can we enforce and ensure that especially my son’s generation that’s — that’s coming into the military as careers, that they understand that it’s OK to get the help that they need', 'How can we change the stereotype', 'OBAMA: Well, first of all, I just want to thank you so much for sharing your story and creating your organization, because this is something we just have to talk about more', 'And I — I honor your — your husband’s service and I thank your son for his service', 'And I thank you for your service because you’re serving along with them', 'And, you know, sometimes the — the weight of — of battle comes home', 'And — and we see this all across our veteran populations', 'Two points I’d make', 'The first is I have instructed the Joint Chiefs and up and down the chain of command that they have a responsibility to destigmatize mental health issues and issues of PTSD and help to explain to everybody in all of the units under their command that there’s nothing weak about asking for help', 'If you break your leg, you’re going to go to a doctor to get that leg healed', 'If, as a consequence of the extraordinary stress and pain that you are witnessing, typically, in a battlefield, something inside you feels like it’s wounded, it’s just like a physical injury', 'You’ve got to go get help', 'And there’s nothing weak about that', 'That’s strong', 'And that is what will allow you then to continue to — with your service and there shouldn’t be a stigma against it', 'And so we’ve tried to do that', 'I mean I’ve done PSAs myself about it', 'We’ve had events in the White House to emphasize this', 'We’ve worked with Congress to try to amplify that message', 'But ultimately, that has to pervade the culture of our military', 'There’s no weakness in asking for help', 'Now, you also have to back it up with resources, so this brings me to my second point', 'We have increased the funding for mental health services since I’ve been president by about 75 percent', 'We’ve increased the number of mental health providers by about 42 percent', 'And part of what we’re trying to do is start early by embedding, in some cases, clinicians, people who can help, in the units in theater, not just when they get back home, so that when something happens, we’re able right away, in addition to going to a chaplain or somebody to — to — to help you process it, you know, you’re not waiting for it to fester or, in some cases, self-medicate, which obviously causes problems, as well', 'So we’re putting money behind this', 'We are hiring more mental health professionals', 'But the fact that there’s still 20 a day who are feeling hopeless means that we’ve got to do more', 'And, you know, anybody who’s watching right now, if you call the, you know, veterans help line, there’s going to be somebody there to answer', 'And unfortunately, the vast majority of the 20 that you’re talking about are not people who are receiving services', 'I’ll just tell you one last quick story', 'One of the most moving moments of my presidency, I get 10 letters a day from people who write me letters', 'And I got a letter from a woman whose husband was going through this', 'And she loved him so much, he was such a patriot, but she was scared that he was going to do something to himself', 'And she asked was there something that I, as commander-in-chief, could do', 'And the letter was moving to me and so I do what I often do with these letters, I — I contacted the bureau', 'I said, can you contact this family and this guy', 'I had forgotten about it', 'And then three years later, at a White House tour, when I’m shaking hands with somebody, a beautiful family, husband, wife, three gorgeous kids and as I’m going down the line shaking hands and I get to this family¸ the guy says, I — sir, I just want to thank you for saving my life', 'And I say, what do you mean', 'He said, well, my wife wrote a letter and as a consequence, somebody at the VA actively contacted me and I started getting help and that’s why I’m here with my little kids here', 'So intervention can work', 'And I think part of what we also have to do is make sure that the families recognize some of the signs', 'And in some cases, you may need to help that individual get help', 'And that’s hard to do, because folks are proud, but it’s something that I think we all have to be thinking about', 'Because we’re putting folks under such strain, and it adds up, no matter how tough you are', 'But God bless you', 'Thank you for everything that you’ve done to help lift this story up', 'TAPPER: Mr', 'President, let’s turn to Colonel Adam Butler who is the Fort Lee Garrison Commander', 'He has served more than 30 years in the Army', 'He just got back from Afghanistan', 'COLONEL ADAM BUTLER: Good afternoon, Mr', 'President', 'Sir, I served twice in Iraq in areas that were recently, later occupied by ISIL', 'Also recently redeployed from Afghanistan', 'Now my question to you, Mr', 'President, is, what do we need to do to ensure the gains made in Afghanistan don’t meet similar fate as they did in Iraq, particularly as it’s related to ISIL occupation', 'OBAMA: Well, the situation in Afghanistan is a little bit different from Iraq, obviously, because the dominant fighting force against the government in Afghanistan is the Taliban, who are not only not affiliated with ISIL right now, but in some cases are fighting ISIL for control of territory', 'The key thing that we’re doing in Afghanistan is twofold', 'One, is continuing to train, assist, support, build up capacity for the Afghan security forces, and they are fighting', 'They’re still fighting the Taliban', 'And they’re not where they need to be as a fighting force yet, but they’re getting better because of the support that we provide them, and this is why I have maintained a certain troop level there until I feel confident that they can walk, and then ultimately run', 'But they’re not quite there yet', 'And it’s important for us to maintain that support and to continue to get other countries working with us as part of the coalition to provide them support', 'The second thing we’re doing is, we are maintaining a CT platform in Afghanistan, because we don’t want ISIL or al-Qaeda or anybody coming back and creating a platform whereby they can attack the homeland', 'And in order for us to have a counter terrorism platform there, which gathers intelligence, allows us to monitor activities, we have to have a certain number of troops just to protect that platform', 'So that’s — those are our two core missions right now', 'I’ll be honest with you, though, there’s going to be a third factor, and this is true in Iraq and it’s true in Afghanistan, and we are having to recognize this', 'Those governments also have to be responsive to people', 'And they have to work to eliminate corruption', 'And their leadership has to say, we’re not going to treat Sunnis differently than Shiite or Kurd or whatever ethnic groups are in these countries', 'And we’re going to actually provide education to kids, including girls, not just boys', 'We can help in these countries, but one of the challenges we’re going to have, not just in Iraq and Afghanistan, but in places like Libya and Yemen and Somalia and other parts of the world, we’re not going to have the capacity to police every one of these countries, or run every one of these countries', 'And at a certain point, our goal has to be, we’ll be your partner, but you guys have to take responsibility', 'Not just for the security situation, but also creating an environment in which radicalism and extremism is not the best option or the preferred option for young men', 'And there are too many countries that aren’t doing enough of that, and so that’s why we have to combine what we do militarily also with the diplomatic efforts, our investments in schools —', 'One of the things that Democrats and Republicans agree on is, we don’t like foreign aid', 'If you take a poll, the thing people hate most is the idea, well, why are we sending money to other countries to help when we’ve got so many things to do here at home', 'But part of what we have to start understanding is, if we can help build some schools and teach kids a better way of doing things and create jobs, improve the productivity of a farmer, that’s part of our national security agenda, and we can’t think of that separately from our military agenda because — we’ll never have enough troops — we’ll never have a big enough budget to be able to simply govern and police every one of these countries around the world', 'Thank you for your service', 'TAPPER: Our final question comes from William Butcher', 'He retired as a colonel in the Army after 30 years of service in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo', 'Sir —', 'WILLIAM BUTCHER: Mr', 'President, you’ve acknowledged it here today', 'Our military continues to be a great place for young men and women to gain the skill, have life experience, and serve proudly in our nation', 'What would you say, and what advice would you give, to Malia and Sasha, if they approached you and expressed interest in serving in our military', 'OBAMA: I’d say, go for it', 'I will tell you, look — I signed up for selective service when I was 18, the Vietnam War had just wound down, there weren’t any active wars, we hadn’t been under attack, and so I took a different course and I didn’t end up serving in our military', 'And then during the course of my work as an adult, and eventually first as a state senator, then a U', 'S', 'senator, and finally, as president, I started having a lot of interactions with our military and our veterans', 'I cannot tell you how incredibly proud I am of our military as an institution', 'There’s a reason why it’s held in the highest esteem of any institution in our country at a time when people are cynical just about everything', 'And the reason is that the quality of the people who are serving right now — I meet 20-year-olds and 23-year-olds and 25-year-olds who are in charge of life and death decisions, and maintaining $100 million pieces of equipment, and taking on responsibilities that their peers, who are still going to keg parties, couldn’t even imagine', 'And Michelle and I, we always talk about this, just how incredibly impressed we are with the quality of young people, the training they’re receiving, the discipline they’re receiving, the patriotism that they’re expressing in our military', 'And so if Malia and Sasha decided that that was an avenue that they wanted to take, I would be proud of them', 'Now, I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t sometimes get nervous about possible deployments', 'Your kids are your kids', 'You want to keep them tucked in in their pajamas for the rest of their lives, if you had the chance', 'But I’d be proud to have them serve, and I think every parent who’s seen their children enter the military are proud', 'It’s interesting', 'We have a number of members of my staff in the White House who themselves have served and their children now are serving, and they were nervous about it initially, and are now saying the way the characters of their children are being shaped, it’s terrific', 'And if you think about how our military is handled, a lot of social issues — our military is not perfect, but it’s handled race issues, for example, better than most other institutions', 'It’s more integrated and provides greater opportunity to a more diverse set of people', 'I know that the issue of don’t ask, don’t tell, was controversial, but once the order came down, military executed, and now we’ve got people who, regardless of who they love, are serving their country and doing a great job and our military does it right', 'So there’s a lot to be proud of', 'We’ve got work to do', 'We’ve got to make sure that

or errors, let alone resigned as a result of disasters suffered under his command', '”', 'It was the Lapiang Malaya massacre that impelled staunch Marcos critic Senator Benigno S', 'Aquino Jr', 'to describe the Philippines thusly: “A land consecrated to democracy but run by an entrenched plutocracy', 'Here, too, are a people whose ambitions run high, but whose fulfillment is low and mainly restricted to the self-perpetuating élite', 'Here is a land of privilege and rank—a republic dedicated to equality but mired in an archaic system of caste', '” Democracy had, observes Manuel L', 'Quezon III, “survived the Huk rebellion; and yet, even the beneficiaries of the relative stability of the mid-Fifties to mid-Sixties left an increasingly better-educated and cosmopolitan urban middle class in discontent', '”', '* * *', 'Students, who would eventually form a key cornerstone of the Philippine political protest, did not take to demonstrations until the late 1960s', 'For the most part, they were politically passive—a condition cultivated by the prevailing political culture then; the marked conservativism of the era, itself bolstered by Filipino values; as well as an education system that strongly promoted harmony between the citizenry and the government, especially considering that the latter signed on 15,000 new hires every year', 'Quirino Samonte writes:', '“—what are the prospects of an activist vis-à-vis the status quo', 'For those who defy the law, the price can be high indeed as exemplified by those who chose to cast their lot with the ‘Huks’—a rebellious movement of peasants that had its roots in the social and economic injustices of agriculture’s tenancy system, but which has since become the feeding ground of Communist agitators', '”', 'And yet, with changing political currents and shifting social mores, campuses would soon thrive as activist hubs', 'The 1960s saw a resurgence of nationalism among college students, who demonstrated against a spectrum of issues—from US imperialism, as seen in the deployment of Philippine troops to the Vietnam War, to the US military bases dotting the Philippines; to specific, sector-based issues that paralleled workers’ movements decades prior', 'The relatively insular but undoubtedly more sweeping issue at the heart of many a student outrage were individual school policies: School administrations would fail to respond to demands of lowered tuition fees, of granting independence to student organizations and publications, of improving facilities and the curriculum', 'Campus activism found campaigns in the widening gap between the rich and the poor, best exemplified by the divide between the working students of the proletariat and the collective elite of a handful of Manila schools, both public and private—hand in hand with this were the proliferation of “diploma mills” within the capital', 'Eva Lotta-Hedman and John Sidel observe:', '“As the demand for formal qualifications and accreditation increased on the urban employment market, privately-run specialist colleges and technical institutes packed unprecedented numbers of fee-paying students into overcrowded and sometimes seriously dilapidated classrooms and even condemned buildings in downtown Manila', 'For example, the Philippine College of Commerce counted among its rapidly growing student population ‘mostly children of the lowest-income groups—laborers, janitors, carpenters, even laundrywomen', '’”', 'Manila was overrun with the children of the laboring classes, outraged at institutions, at society, and at the state', 'All of this roundly grew into a pitch, the calls for reform and demonstrations of discontent galvanizing into solid movements', 'By the late 1960s, Lotta-Hedman and Sidel note, students would, as collectives, picket campuses, march in the streets of Manila, and demonstrate outside Congress:', '“Whilst this wave of student activism focused but brief attention on ‘dialogue’ and ‘reform’ at the top of college administrations as well as national government, it also left behind a battle-scarred downtown area where buildings with broken and boarded-up windows remained a powerful testimony to the moment of struggle, thus recalling fragments of collective memory from the amnesia of history through lived experience itself', '”', 'The culture of activism, with its reformists and its radicals, would only strengthen; there was power in the demonstration, of making one’s voice heard in a disruptive mass; one would not be ignored', 'Soon enough, campus activism would branch out, coalesce among classes, and reach out to integrate plights other than theirs: The provincial poor, the working class', 'The power of the masses, led by a youth made aware of their ability to compel the state to stop and listen, would reach a bloody climax in 1970, with what would be recorded in our history books as the First Quarter Storm', 'Toward the end of 1969; Ferdinand E', 'Marcos won an unprecedented full second term as president in, Lewis Gleeck Jr', 'writes, “the most violent and fraudulent campaign the country had ever seen', '” At this point, fervent calls for a revolution were not isolated to reformists and radicals, but involved conservative circles as well', 'Discontent was building solidarity: Sympathizers from all walks of life would link arms and protest an increasingly unpopular and thoroughly objectionable administration', 'The reelection of a president no one wanted any longer brought in a tide of outrage, one that lasted and lingered for three months, marked by often violent demonstrations: “The radical students, already disdainful of a political system dominated by elitist, ideologically indistinguishable parties, reacted to Marcos’ tainted reelection with a vengeance', '”', 'The First Quarter Storm officially began on January 26, 1970, on the streets surrounding Congress, where Marcos delivered the first State of the Nation Address (SONA) of his second term', 'Student organizations, spearheaded by the National Union of Students of the Philippines and with the support of workers and members of the urban poor, crafted a manifesto in preparation for the SONA; a permit to rally was applied for, and some 20,000 people trooped to Congress', 'They were met, however, by a cadre of uniformed men in battle gear garlanding the streets, patrolling entry points', 'The rally went on peacefully beneath the blare of the sound system carrying Marcos’ SONA, which boasted of the country’s improved peace and order situation', 'But when Marcos and his wife Imelda exited the halls of Congress, demonstrators—spurred on by agitators and harassed by uniformed personnel—rushed at them, throwing bottles and placards and stones as they entered their limousine', 'The security force pushed back at the demonstrators', 'The mob was broken up by the police with batons; students were beaten with truncheons', 'Two accounts give opposing views of the January 26 protest', 'Jose F', '“Pete” Lacaba sympathizes with the student demonstrators in his classic, “The January 26 Confrontation: A Highly Personal Account', '” Lacaba was outside with the students and described the violence in detail: students were chased by the police, hauled out of jeepneys, and beaten with rattan sticks', 'Lacaba himself took a blow to his waist from a policeman', 'Kerima Polotan’s account, “The Long Week,” tells a different story', 'From inside Congress, she took fashion notes—a who’s who in barong, coat and tie, or terno—and offered snide remarks at the expense of members of the opposition, such as Senators Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr', 'and Gerardo “Gerry” Roxas', 'Her account of the violence outside was taken from Manila Police District chief Colonel Gerardo Tamayo: one cop lost four teeth, another received ten stitches on his head, another sustained a nail in his knee', 'On January 30, to protest the violent dispersal of the January 26 student-led rally, another demonstration was held in front of Malacañan Palace—candles burned beside an effigy of a coffin, to symbolize the death of democracy', 'In the streets that radiated from the Palace, more and more protesters were gathering, marching toward the breach in the gates; as security tried to break up the mobs, doors would open to the rallyists, second-floor windows opened revealing strangers serving as frantic look-outs', 'The “clean-up” of the street protests took some seven hours, with shows of solidarity in an increasingly bloody evening punished by a police force that did not distinguish between protesters and sympathizers', '(In the meantime, Nick Joaquin, notes: “That night, an exodus of privilege made ghost towns of the exclusive villages in the suburbs; the chi-chi crowd, fear in their guts and guilt in their hearts, holed up with their hysteria in the big hotels, driven there by the certainty that Forbes Park and Bel-Air and Dasmariñas and Magallanes would be set afire by an avenging people', '”)', 'Rallyists retaliated with force', 'They started fires and destroyed property; a fire truck was rammed into the Palace gates', 'At Mendiola, students armed with bamboo sticks faced off against a battalion wielding heavy artillery', 'Demonstrators were killed—one 23-year-old student, performing in a mock trial of a Marcos effigy, was shot in the head—several others wounded in clashes that ran late into the night', 'Marcos, in his diaries, wrote about the siege of his Palace:', '“…demonstrators numbering about 10,000 students and laborers stormed Malacañan Palace, burning part of the medical building, crashing through Gate 4 with a fire truck that had been forcibly commandeered by some laborers and students amidst shouts of ‘Mabuhay Dante', '’ and slogans from Mao-Tse-Tung, the new Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People’s Army', 'The rioters sought to enter Malacañang but the Metropolitan Command (METROCOM) of the Philippine Constabulary and the Presidential Guards repulsed them towards Mendiola Bridge, where in an exchange of gunfire, hours later, four persons were killed and scores from both sides injured', 'The crowd was finally dispersed by tear gas grenades', '”', 'Though the protracted battle between authorities and students who stormed the Palace would conclude by dawn, the First Quarter Storm would only escalate, sustained by a citizenry disillusioned and outraged by the state’s intolerant and violent responses to expressions of democracy', 'A year after the First Quarter Storm, in the lead-up to the 1971 midterm elections, UP students, supported by faculty members and non-academic personnel, staged a sympathy strike in support of Pasang Masda, an organization of jeepney drivers that protested gas price hikes', 'The students occupied the Diliman campus and blockaded its main roads through the use of a new weapon of protest: the human barricade', 'This nine-day uprising was known as the “Diliman Commune', '” Some residents in the area banded together and hunted down the radical students in the defense of order and their property rights', 'President Marcos ordered the Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command to retake the campus', 'The Philippine Constabulary went to UP and dismantled the barricades; three students died in the violence that ensued', 'The demonstrations in UP Diliman ended only after the school administration accepted some of the demands of the students', 'The military siege was put to a halt following a recommendation made by university president Salvador Lopez to President Marcos', 'One contemporary observer noted that after the Diliman commune, “protest classes, boycotts, demonstrations became almost a daily spectacle that would beset the University until the declaration of martial law', '”', '* * *', 'Lotta-Hedman and Sidel note that, given “the mounting political activism that swept Manila campuses during this decade, students increasingly left their classrooms throughout the University belt not only to shop for food or school supplies, or watch movies, but to join in the mass demonstrations that filed through or converged upon downtown', 'As students, faculty members, workers, and peasants alike—and sometimes, together—launched new radical organisations and engaged in concerted collective campaigns during the course of the decade', 'Plaza Miranda—‘the crossroads of the nation’—became a familiar destination not just for Nazareno devotees, downmarket clients, and during election years, political candidates, but also for mass activists–as well as the Metropolitan Anti-Riot squads organised for the occasion', '”', 'Located no more than a kilometer from Malacañan Palace, Plaza Miranda was the largest venue from which rallyists could be physically close to the residence of the country’s chief executive, whether in loyal support or oppositionist denunciation', 'In the era of grand demonstrations and mass mobilizations, National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin, in his Almanac for Manileños, described Plaza Miranda as “the crossroads of the nation, the forum of the land', '” President Ramon Magsaysay, arguably the most popular of our postwar chief executives, famously recognized the square as a gauge of public opinion when he asked a proponent of a policy or project: “Can we defend this at Plaza Miranda', '” Far removed from the closed, air-conditioned rooms of Congress or cushioned seats in public buildings, bringing an issue to Plaza Miranda was the ultimate act of transparency and accountability, where the people, any Juan or Juana de la Cruz, could question their government', 'A year following the First Quarter Storm, the political situation in Manila and throughout the country was at a fever pitch', 'Growing disenchantment with Marcos put his political future at stake with the 1971 midterm Senatorial elections—the traditional dividing line between a president’s continued political relevance or reduction to lame duck', 'The sons of Presidents Osmeña and Roxas, united under the Liberal Party, led the opposition to President Ferdinand Marcos', 'Senators Sergio Osmeña Jr', 'and Gerardo Roxas were both victims in the Plaza Miranda bombing, which would indelibly link the Liberal Party of the Philippines to the public square’s identity as the forum of Philippine democracy', 'On August 21, 1971, at the miting de avance of the Liberal Party in Plaza Miranda, the square became the scene of two simultaneous grenade attacks that nearly liquidated the party’s leadership, just as Senator Roxas, Liberal Party President, was proclaiming his party’s candidates for the City of Manila', 'Among those who sustained serious injury were: Roxas, Osmeña, Senators Jovito Salonga, Genaro Magsaysay, Eva Estrada-Kalaw (a Nacionalista guest candidate of the LP), and senatorial bets John Henry Osmeña and Ramon Mitra Jr', 'Roxas would hold President Marcos responsible for the attack:', '“The Plaza Miranda incident has illustrated beyond doubt that there is not a safe place in the country where people may express their views without having to face the perils of assassination', 'I have only one message to leaders, followers and the electorate: Nothing will deter the LP nor dampen its determination to win the mandate of the people this election', 'We shall continue to fight for the right of our citizenry', 'I am grateful to the Almighty for those of us who were fortunate to have been spared', '”', 'Widely considered the most blatant assault on free speech and guaranteed democratic rights at the time, many quarters believed it to be masterminded by Marcos himself, which led to increased opposition to his administration', 'Three months later, the polls resulted in a Senate sweep by the Liberals, with only two Marcos allies making it into the winner’s circle', 'The President’s alter egos—Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Secretary of Labor Blas Ople—were among the losers', 'The Marcos years, characterized by the Machiavellian exercise of power preservation, fomented political unrest: Alleged graft and corruption by the administration and her cronies would worsten the disparity of wealth and grow the gap between the extremely wealthy and the very poor', 'Civilians took to rioting, which fed the administration’s hunger to be on the defensive and thus respond with aggression', 'This heightened sense of control meant the suppression of civil liberties and before long, President Ferdinand Marcos found himself addressing the public, justifying the need for power to be vested solely in his hands', 'On the afternoon of September 21, 1972, the last protest before the declaration of Martial Law was held in Plaza Miranda', 'Sponsored by Concerned Christians for Civil Liberties, the demonstration was attended by a crowd of 30,000 people from different sectors—civic, religious, labor, student, and activist', 'The September 23, 1972 declaration of Martial Law planted the seeds of discontent that would make dissent and revolution necessary—even vital—to the restoration of democracy', 'Urban protest did not vanish entirely, even under Martial Law', 'On the day before the Interim Batasang Pambansa elections, for example, residents of Metro Manila organized a show of support for the incarcerated ex-Senator Ninoy Aquino, who was the leader of the opposition candidates: the noise barrage held on April 6, 1978, would become one of the most famous protests of the era', 'At 8:00 p', 'm', ', people went out into the streets, making whatever noise they could “to let Ninoy Aquino in his prison cell know that the people had heard his message', '” They banged on pots and pans, honked their car horns, and shouted their throats sore in support of Ninoy and his party, Lakas ng Bayan (LABAN; the People’s Power)', 'A period of relative quiet followed; but in 1983, the assassination of the foremost critic of the Marcos dictatorship—the man who was among those first arrested in the declaration of Martial Law—revived the nation out of inaction', 'Fifteen minutes after Ninoy Aquino returned to the country after three years of exile in the United States, he was dead on the tarmac of the Manila International Airport', 'Chairman of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, Maria Serena I', 'Diokno, writes, “It was the Aquino assassination, more than any other event in the Marcos regime’s long history of repression and violence, which moved countless Filipinos, especially the once-timid middle class, to awaken and jointly fight the reality of dictatorship', 'For many it was, in the words of a Makati businessman ‘', 'the spark that gave us the courage to speak up', '’ Indeed, from that shocking moment on the tarmac in August 1983 until the EDSA Revolution in February 1986, numerous organizations emerged to protest the iron strength of the Marcos dictatorship', '”', 'Until then, the country’s demonstrators had been stilled under Martial Law, with the regime unrelenting in its campaign to stifle free speech, much less audacious displays of opposition', 'But with Aquino’s assassination, Filipinos took to the streets to honor the dead, to cast their lot with the fallen hero', 'It was in the streets of Manila, with Ninoy Aquino’s funeral cortege escorted by millions, that the Filipino people themselves undertook what the dictatorship denied: The flag in front of the Rizal Monument was lowered to half-mast, in symbolic tribute from the Republic’s protomartyr to its new martyr of democracy', 'Diokno writes of the sea-change regarding popular outrage that gained strength on August 31, 1983: “On that day, about two million Filipinos turned out to be counted; they joined the procession, lined the streets, displayed banners and ribbons, and chanted all throughout an eleven-hour journey', 'The unprecedented funeral set the tone for the protest movement that was to evolve', 'It was a movement that in the next two years increasingly challenged the Marcos regime’s stockpile of teargas, bullets, and repressive presidential decrees', 'In subsequent rallies and varied mass actions, demonstrators, linking arms and bearing no weapons, bravely faced the U', 'S', '-supplied arms of the state', '”', 'The indignation and the grief, fuelling the resurgence of democratic expression, spread across all sectors—the country had once again found a single banner from which it could unite and struggle, against the innumerable abuses of the Marcos regime', 'When before efforts to mobilize the masses would come to naught or prove at best to be ephemeral, the anti-government protests following Ninoy’s death would last months, and once again bring to the fore movements that would usher in more definitive campaigns for the restoration of democracy in the Philippines', 'Mark Thompson shares government estimates of the upswell of protest inspired by Ninoy’s murder: “165 rallies, marches, and other demonstrations took place between August 21 and September 30, 1983', 'The largest was Aquino’s funeral procession in Manila, which took eleven hours and was attended by an estimated 2 million people', 'Protest demonstrations continued into the following year, with more than 100 held between October 1983 and February 1984', 'The biggest of these was the 120-kilometer ‘Tarlac to Tarmac’ run (from Aquino’s home province to the international airport where he was murdered), attended by an estimated five hundred thousand people', '” The protest movement swept across socioeconomic strata—even, notably, among the country’s middle-class and sympathetic elite', 'In Ayala Avenue, the country’s foremost financial and business district, meetings, public demonstrations, and protest marches would be held weekly following the Aquino assassination to the beat of ati-atihan drums, and often under a blanket of yellow confetti drifting from the buildings', 'The murder of Ninoy Aquino during the Marcos regime would set in motion the beginning of the revolution that would reclaim the country from the dictatorship', 'Marcos would struggle to maintain his control over the people, even instigating charades of democracy: On February 7, 1986, nationwide snap elections were held for the presidency and the newly restored position of vice president', 'The contenders were the tandem of Marcos and Arturo M', 'Tolentino, versus Cory Aquino, widowed spouse of assassinated Ninoy, and Salvador H', 'Laurel', 'Aquino had proven her charismatic and emblematic sway over the people just months prior; the Cory Aquino for President Movement had ensured for her 1', '2 million signatures calling for her candidacy alone—a feat rendered more remarkable given the suppressions of the times', 'However, as the votes were tallied, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) numbers showed Marcos and Tolentino the winners, a result made official by the Batasang Pambansa', 'As government tried to rubberstamp its way to victory, a series of astounding events began to grip the world’s attention: computer operators tabulating Comelec votes walked out; the bishops of the Catholic Church issued a pastoral letter saying a government that cheated was devoid of legitimacy; Cory Aquino called for a civil disobedience campaign and a boycott of crony-owned corporations until the opposition victory was recognized', 'Within two weeks of the snap elections, multitudes of demonstrators would fill the vast expanse of EDSA calling for—and achieving—the peaceful ouster of a dictator', 'The Revolution of 1986 sparked a selfless sense of community in multitudes, rarely seen in such demonstrations', 'Edwin Lacierda, presidential spokesperson of Cory’s son, Benigno S', 'Aquino III, was there to witness: “More than a rally,” he recalls, “all of us came to EDSA to break bread and fellowship with all who were willing to stand in the line of fire and take the bullet, as it were, for freedom and change of government', '”', 'When Jaime Cardinal Sin broadcasted his famous message to gather at EDSA over Radio Veritas, hundreds of thousands heeded the call', 'Food was never a problem, thanks to volunteer “food brigades”; there was always a pot of rice, a pan of pancit, tins of crackers to be passed around', 'When rumors spread of a potential teargas attack, residents near camps Crame and Aguinaldo scrambled to provide protesters with wet handkerchiefs and towels', 'People did not hesitate to sacrifice their cars to barricade the advance of the tanks; one owner simply shrugged off the threat of losing his automobile and said, “Some things are worth more', '”', '* * *', 'When the Malolos Congress—which ushered in the birth of the First Philippine Republic—was ratified, among the witnesses was a delegation of Filipino soldiers who had marched away from a Manila that they had won but which was barred to them:

victory', 'There, witnessing the foundation of a true modern state for Filipinos, was an army that had won back the country, to no recognition of two warring conquerors', 'The old trope of paths not

either policy', 'State Department Inspector General, May 26: The Department’s current policy, implemented in 2005, is that normal day-to-day operations should be conducted on an authorized Automated

Federal agencies to ensure information security for the systems that support the agency’s operations and assets, including information security protections for information systems used by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency', 'FISMA defines information security as protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide for the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the information and systems', 'In 2006, as required by FISMA, NIST [National Institute of

insisted that she complied with that records requirement, too, because she sent emails to department staffers who had government email addresses', 'At a March 10 press conference, when she first took

preserved immediately on the system at the State Department', '”', 'Clinton, March 10: I fully complied with every rule that I was governed by', 'The IG report said that is not the case', 'It said Clinton’s method of preserving work-related emails was insufficient under the Federal Records Act', 'State Department Inspector General, May 26: As previously discussed, however, sending emails from a personal account to other employees at their Department accounts is not an appropriate method of preserving any such emails that would constitute a Federal record', 'Therefore, Secretary Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary', 'At a minimum, Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and, because she did not do so, she did not comply with the Department’s

mind at the time, because she was copying and sending” emails to people within the State Department,” Fallon said', '“She believed that all those emails were captured,” he said', '‘Same Thing’ As Her

was the same as other secretaries of state, as she did in a CNN interview on July 7, 2015, in a March 9 debate, and again in the ABC interview on May 26 after the report came out', 'Clinton, July 7,

secretaries of state — I mean, Secretary Powell has admitted he did exactly the same thing', 'Clinton, March 9: I made a mistake', 'It was not prohibited', 'It was not in any way disallowed', 'And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government', 'Clinton, May 26: This report makes clear that personal email use was the practice for other secretaries of state', 'She was wrong to say “my predecessors did the same thing,” as we have pointed out before', 'The IG report confirms that among Clinton’s predecessors only Powell used personal email for government business', 'Madeleine Albright did not use email at all, and Condoleezza Rice did not use personal email to conduct government business, the IG report says', 'Secretary of State John Kerry, who followed Clinton, told the inspector general’s office that he “infrequently” used personal email for government business “when responding to a sender who emailed him on his personal account', '”', 'Even now Clinton twists the facts when she claims, as she did in the ABC News interview, that “personal email use was the practice for other secretaries of state” — meaning Powell and Kerry', 'It was the practice for Powell, but it was the exception for Kerry, so the plural use of “secretaries” is misleading — especially in light of the IG report', 'In what reads like a direct rebuttal to Clinton’s claim that other secretaries of state have done the same thing, the IG report notes that the department’s policies on the use of personal email and nongovernment computer systems were “considerably more detailed and more sophisticated” during Clinton’s tenure', 'It said she should be “evaluated” differently than her predecessors', '“Beginning in late 2005 and continuing through 2011, the Department revised the FAM [Foreign Affairs Manual] and issued various memoranda specifically discussing the obligation to use Department [computer] systems in most circumstances and identifying the risks of not doing so,” the report says', '“Secretary Clinton’s cybersecurity practices accordingly must be evaluated in light of these more comprehensive directives', '”', 'In addition to the policies we outlined from the mid-2000s, the report noted specific instances in which State Department officials acted to discourage the use of personal email for government business', 'For example, on March 11, 2011, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security sent a memo to Clinton that said there has been “a dramatic increase since January 2011 in attempts by [redacted] cyber actors to compromise the private home e-mail accounts of senior Department officials', '” That was followed by two high-level meetings in April and May 2011 on cybersecurity that were attended by “the Secretary’s immediate staff', '”', 'What followed was a cable that went out under Clinton’s name that “recommended best practices for Department users and their family members to follow, including ‘avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts,’” the report said, quoting from Clinton’s cable', 'Taking Note', 'The report also addressed some other notable issues:', 'The department did not ask the four former secretaries of state, including Clinton, to sign separation agreements certifying that they had turned over all work-related documents', 'Clinton has been criticized by Republican strategist Karl Rove and others — for failing to sign the statement, but that was part of the department’s “systemic weaknesses” and not unique to Clinton', 'Two staffers in the Bureau of Information Resource Management expressed “their concerns about Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email account in separate meetings” with the bureau director', '“According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary’s personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further,” the report said', 'But no legal review was done and no approval was granted', 'Hackers attempted to access Clinton’s server on Jan', '9, 2011, and a phishing email message was sent to Clinton on May 13, 2011, that contained a suspicious link', 'Both attempted breaches should have been reported', '“However, OIG found no evidence that the Secretary or her staff reported these incidents to computer security personnel or anyone else within the Department,” the report said', 'Clinton and seven of her former department staffers declined to be interviewed by the IG’s office, as well as “an individual based in New York who provided technical support for Secretary Clinton’s personal email system but who was never employed by the Department', '”', 'Clinton admits she made a mistake when she decided to use a personal email and server to conduct public business', 'But she has been less than forthright as she has tried to spin the facts in an attempt to minimize her admitted mistake', 'The IG report makes it clear that occasional use of personal email for government business would have been acceptable as long as Clinton’s emails were preserved by the department before she left office', 'But the department policies at the time prevented her or anyone else from using a personal account exclusively for government business — let alone a personal server, which should have been registered with the department but was not', 'Updated, May 27: This article was revised to clarify Fallon’s comments on the IG’s finding that Clinton “did not comply with the Department’s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act', '” We added that Fallon said the Clinton campaign agrees with the IG finding that “her practice

committee that wrote the report, and Boyd Professor, Coastal Studies Institute, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge', '\"This doesn\\'t mean we can ignore hazards from drilling and shipping, however', 'Although new safety standards and advances in technology reduced the amount of oil that spilled during extraction and transport in the last two decades, the potential is still there for a large spill, especially in regions with lax safety controls', '\"To better monitor how much oil consumers and industry are depositing in the ocean, federal agencies should work with state and local environmental bureaus to develop a system for documenting sources of runoff, the report says', 'In addition, the U', 'S', 'Environmental Protection Agency should continue efforts to phase out older, inefficient two-stroke engines, which power many jet skis and other small watercraft', \"The committee's calculations of how much petroleum is added to the sea each year were based on data from a variety of sources\", \"The accuracy of these data is much improved since the Research Council's last assessment in 1985\", 'The amount of petroleum released into North American and global waters is less than previously thought, the committee found', 'At the same time, however, new studies show that the environmental effects of a major oil spill are longer lasting than once thought and that even small amounts of petroleum can seriously damage marine life and ecosystems', 'SOURCES OF OIL IN THE SEAOil slicks visible from the air and birds painted black by oil get the most public attention, but it is consumers of oil -- not the ships that transport it -- who are responsible for most of what finds its way into the ocean, the report says', 'For example, oil runoff from cars and trucks is increasing in coastal areas where the population is growing and roads and parking lots are expanding to accommodate it', 'Rivers polluted by oil in waste water or the improper disposal of petroleum products are a significant source of oil in the sea as well', 'In addition, older two-stroke engines still found on many recreational boats and jet skis were purposely designed to discharge gasoline and oil', 'Land runoff and recreational boating account for nearly three-quarters of the 25 million gallons of petroleum released into the sea annually through the consumption of petroleum', 'Other sources of oil from human activities include military and commercial jets that occasionally jettison excess fuel over the ocean and ships that release oil from their engines while in port or at sea', 'More than one-half of the land-based oil contamination along the North American coastline occurs between Maine and Virginia, where there are dense seaside populations, many cities, several

to assess and minimize the potential for a significant spill from pipelines and other coastal facilities', 'The exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas introduces 880,000 gallons of

'This would help researchers distinguish the effects of petroleum released by natural processes versus human activities, and study how marine life responds to the introduction of oil', 'ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTSThe impact of an oil spill on marine life is not directly related to the size of the spill, since even a small spill in an ecologically sensitive area can have long-term adverse effects, the report says', \"A spill's influence also depends on the type and amount of toxins present in the petroleum product being released\", 'The riskiest toxins are a class of organic compounds known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs', 'Growing evidence suggests that PAHs and other toxic compounds can have adverse effects on marine species even at very low concentrations', 'This means chronic releases from runoff and recreational boating may inflict more damage than previously thought, and that the effects of large spills may last as long as residual oil persists in the area', 'Significant research has been conducted in recent years -- particularly in the wake of the EXXON VALDEZ spill -- confirming that large oil spills can be devastating to the marine environment', 'They
