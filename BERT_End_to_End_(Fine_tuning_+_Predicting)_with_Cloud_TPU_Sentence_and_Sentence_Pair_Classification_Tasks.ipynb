Istanbul—they’ve all been hit by terrorism', 'And, as we saw when a terrorist cell in Hamburg carried out the 9/11 attacks: What happens in Europe has a way of making it to America', 'So it’s essential that we have strong partners who can work with us to disrupt plots and dismantle networks in their own countries before they lead to attacks in ours', 'America needs European intelligence services working hand-in-hand with our own, including where they may have better reach and expertise, like in North Africa', 'We need European banks to stop terrorist financing', 'We need European planes flying missions over Iraq and Syria, and European special forces helping train and equip local anti-ISIS forces on the ground', 'We need European diplomats and development experts working to improve governance and reduce the appeal of extremism across the wide arc of instability that stretches from West Africa all the way to Asia; together, we can do more', 'And, more urgently, to support moderate voices and stand with Tunisians, Libyans, Kurds, and others in the region who are trying to do the right thing', 'And as we should, of course, be closely consulting with Israel—our strongest ally in the Middle East—we also have to extend our consultations to Arab partners as well', 'All of this will make America safer, and help defeat ISIS', 'There is much we can do to support our European partners: helping them improve intelligence and law enforcement, facilitating information sharing, working more closely at every level', 'There’s also more they can do to share the burden with us', 'We’d like to see more European countries investing in defense and security, following the example Germany and others have set during the Obama administration', 'The most urgent task is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East', 'Thousands of young recruits have flocked to Syria from France, Germany, Belgium, and the United Kingdom', 'Their European passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home, radicalized and battle-hardened', 'We need to know the identities of every fighter who makes that trip and start revoking passports and visas', 'Stemming this tide will require much better coordination among every country along the way', 'Right now, many European nations don’t even alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen', 'And Turkey, a NATO ally, still has more work to do to control the border where most foreign fighters cross into Syria', 'After the Paris attack, France and Belgium pledged to move forward together on reforms—but that’s difficult without the European Union', 'In January, the EU announced a new, integrated counterterrorism center, but intelligence cooperation still lags, and the EU keeps delaying a vote to share traveler information between member states', 'It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U', 'S', 'negotiated when I was secretary of state', 'There also has to be a special emphasis on identifying and investing in the hot spots—the specific neighborhoods, prisons, and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, as we’ve seen in Brussels', 'And it’s time to make good on the promise of establishing a new unified European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen the continent’s external borders, which are under unprecedented pressure from refugees and migrants', 'Now, this is a heartbreaking crisis', 'Last year, the world was horrified by the photo of a drowned toddler lying on a Turkish beach', 'In the months since then, hundreds more children have died trying to reach safety', 'We’ve seen Europe and Syria’s neighbors in the Middle East struggle under the weight of this challenge', 'It’s too big for any one country—or even continent—to handle alone', 'I’m glad that the EU and Turkey are now working closely together—and the United States should do whatever we can to support that', 'The only truly effective answer is to go to the source: End the conflict that is displacing all these people', 'So we have to support and maintain the ceasefire in Syria', 'And we should also work with our coalition partners and opposition forces on the ground to create safe areas where Syrians can remain in the country rather than fleeing toward Europe', 'In the meantime, it would be wrong to shut our doors to orphans or to apply religious tests for people fleeing persecution', 'That’s not who we are', 'But of course we have to be vigilant in screening and vetting everyone', 'We can’t allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and humanitarian obligations—but we also have to be smart and vigilant about how we process people into our country', 'It would be doubly cruel if ISIS can not only force families from their homes, and but also prevent them from ever finding new ones', 'And that brings me to my third point: In our fight against radical jihadism, we have to do what actually works', 'One thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims', 'There are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in this country', 'These Americans are a crucial line of defense against terrorism', 'They are the most likely to recognize the warning signs of radicalization before it’s too late, and the best positioned to block it', 'Last year in Minneapolis, I met parents, teachers, imams, and others in the Somali-American community who are working with law enforcement and mental health professionals to intervene with young people at risk of being radicalized', 'Efforts like that deserve more local and national support', 'Since 9/11, law enforcement has worked hard to build trustful and strong relationships with American Muslim communities', 'As the director of the FBI told Congress: Anything that erodes that trust makes their job more difficult', 'We need every American community invested in this fight, not fearful and sitting on the sidelines', 'So when Republican candidates like Ted Cruz call for treating American Muslims like criminals, and for racially profiling predominantly-Muslim neighborhoods, it’s wrong', 'It’s counterproductive', 'It’s dangerous', 'As a spokesman for the New York Police Department pointed out last night, that kind of blanket bigotry would treat the city’s nearly 1,000 Muslim police officers as threats', '“It’s hard to imagine a more incendiary, foolish statement,” he said', 'Commissioner Bill Bratton of the NYPD was even more blunt this morning: He said Senator Cruz “doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about', '”', 'Demonizing Muslims also alienates partners and undermines moderates we need around the world in the fight against ISIS', 'There’s been a lot of talk from both Republicans and Democrats about the importance of building coalitions with Muslim nations', 'Having actually done this, I can tell you: Insulting allies and partners is not a good way to start', 'Another thing we know that does not work—based on lots of empirical evidence—is torture', 'Many intelligence, military and law enforcement experts have attested to this fact', 'It also puts our own troops—and, increasingly, our own civilians—at greater risk', 'I’m proud to have been a part of the administration that banned torture, after too many years in which we had lost our way', 'And if I’m president, the United States will not condone or practice torture anywhere in the world', 'Even when we’re up against opponents who don’t respect human life or human rights, torture is not the right choice', 'As Senator John McCain has said: The high standard to which we hold ourselves “isn’t about our enemies; it’s about us', 'It’s about who we were, who we are and who we aspire to be', '”', 'America is a great nation', 'And this is a time for American leadership', 'Smart, strong, steady leadership', 'No other country can rally allies and partners to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism', 'Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale in defense of our people and our values', 'America doesn’t cower in fear or hide behind walls', 'We lead—and we succeed', 'Throughout our history, we have stared into the face of evil and refused to blink—whether it was fascism, the Cold War, or hunting down Osama bin Laden', 'And we will defeat ISIS, too', 'No enemy or adversary should ever underestimate the determination of the American people', 'I will never forget what it was like to arrive in Brussels for the first time as secretary of state, in March of 2009', 'I was on my way to NATO', 'NATO headquarters was buzzing', 'Hundreds of young people at the European Parliament had stood and cheered—not for me, but for the idea of American leadership; for the promise of an alliance that delivered unprecedented peace and prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic', 'That’s what we need to remember today', 'Americans cannot—and I believe will not—turn on each other, turn on our allies, or turn away from our principles', 'We’re in it for the long haul', 'And that means we’re going to work together', 'And we’re going to prevail', 'This may be another one of the long struggles we have confronted from time to time in our history, but—like all the rest of those—if we can forge a bipartisan consensus, if we can bring our people to understand what this struggle means to us, if we can maintain our alliances and our partnerships, we will be successful', 'And that will benefit not only our country, but the world', 'And that, when you boil it down, is what American leadership has to be about', 'Thank you']\n",

cap property tax growth at no more than 2% a year', 'And we put the same 2% cap on the interest arbitration awards that were giving rise to higher taxes', 'We must never forget that the root cause of rising property taxes is always excessive government spending', 'As with all problems, you must get to that root cause – and together, we did it', 'And here’s the good news: it is working', 'Last week, the state’s largest newspaper announced the results of its comprehensive study of property taxes in New Jersey', 'The headline said it all: “At long last, tax relief', '”', 'Step three was to get a grip on our long-term liabilities', 'Our pension system was $54 billion in debt at the start of 2011, and scheduled to be underwater by $180 billion in three short decades without a change in course', 'It was imperative that we save these pensions for our middle class and at the same time lift the burden off of our taxpayers created by the unrealistic promises made by career politicians', 'And so we confronted the obvious, negotiated a solution and saved taxpayers over $120 billion dollars', 'The pensions of every state worker, of every teacher, and of every retired municipal employee are more secure today', 'By the tough choices we made together, we saved their pensions', 'Again, the solutions were not easy, and not always popular, but they were also not complicated', 'We had to raise the retirement age a bit; we had to get a grip on the effect of COLAs; we had to make sure that the contributions of employees were fair, and that the state kicked in also', 'But by taking these steps we made a big dent in the problem', 'At the same time, we had a public employee health system that was $67 billion in deficit in January of 2011', 'To right this wrong, we relied on two simple principles: we should give employees more choice and everyone must pay their fair share', 'We, once again, compromised with each other to right a failing system and, in the process made political history in New Jersey', 'We came together', 'We took on the special interests', 'We put our citizens first', 'At the time, the New York Post said we had pulled off “something of a miracle” in pension reform', 'But it wasn’t magic', 'In a country dominated in so many places by partisan bickering, we just had to be honest and realistic about the math, and grown-up about the answers', 'And the good news is this – the people of New Jersey can take it', 'We’ve shown the rest of the country that we are Jersey strong', 'Today, the results of that Jersey strength and that Jersey attitude are beginning to show', 'Since our administration came into office, New Jersey has added over 60,000 new private sector jobs', 'Remember, in 2009, the state lost 117,000 jobs', 'According to Rutgers University economist Joseph Seneca, 2011 was the best private sector job growth year in New Jersey since 2000', '60,000 new private sector jobs since we took office', 'The best job growth year in more than 11 years', 'Here is my promise to the people of New Jersey: We will keep the momentum going', 'I will not permit anyone to re-impose the tax raising, overspending, irresponsible ways of our past which led to our dark decade of joblessness in New Jersey', 'Stand strong with me and I will stand up for you', 'We are going in the right direction and I will oppose any move to return us to the despair those policies brought to New Jersey and its citizens', 'The new direction is clear', 'We have changed the business environment in this state and, as a result, we are changing the jobs environment', 'From Asurion (which established its regional headquarters in Bridgewater), to Allergan (which picked New Jersey for its northeast research and development center), we have been able to attract new jobs from around the country to New Jersey', 'From Watson Pharmaceuticals (which moved to Parsippany), to Pinnacle Foods (which moved to Cherry Hill), employers are beginning to understand that New Jersey is once again a friendly state for businesses and jobs – a great place to work and raise a family', 'And it’s not just around the country', 'People are recognizing the New Jersey Comeback all around the world… Bayer put its North American headquarters in Morris County, Novo Nordisk in Middlesex County, and LG Electronics in Bergen County', 'We have begun this turnaround in the face of strong national headwinds', 'Across our country, growth is still anemic', 'There has been no national solution to our debt and deficit problem, no catalyst for growth, no leadership on the economy', 'The politics of envy have overtaken the imperative of opportunity', 'Our economy suffers while Washington politicians – in both parties – fiddle', 'America’s position of strength and leadership around the world deteriorates while our leaders bicker and blame', 'Over the last two years New Jersey did the exact opposite', 'We achieved results because we did it together', 'Over the last two years we’ve said – let’s put aside our differences on some issues so we’re able to work together on others', 'Now it doesn’t mean we didn’t shout at each other', 'It doesn’t mean we didn’t get angry', 'You may even recall that even some of my friends had some very colorful nicknames for me', 'Now, that anger is natural, that passion is good, but we have shown that on the important issues, on the really big things, we can still come together to lead the people of New Jersey to a better outcome', 'We’ve shown that it’s possible to hold fast to key principles, but still reach compromise', 'We’ve shown New Jersey, and the nation that there is a better way', 'That divided government can work; that Democrats and Republicans working together is possible', 'And in fact it’s necessary', 'Two years ago at my inaugural, I asked Senator Sweeney and Speaker Oliver to join me in a handshake to demonstrate our commitment to working together – sticking to our principles, but finding common ground for the good of the people', 'Our handshake that day was a symbol, because it could be nothing more than that', 'Back then, we had nothing to show the people but our good faith and the promise for tomorrow', 'Today, no symbolic handshake is needed', 'Thankfully, we have shown through our deeds that we are willing to work together', 'Substance over form', 'Accomplishments over partisanship', 'Thank you, Steve', 'Thank you, Sheila', 'So in this year, in 2012, let us continue to show the state and the nation what is possible', 'Let New Jersey continue to set the example', 'Let New Jersey continue to lead the way', 'And let us do it together', '***', 'Over the last two years we’ve had to make some tough choices', 'It was important to do what was difficult and what was necessary to get New Jersey out of its hole', 'But, because of these hard decisions, the shared sacrifice and because we stuck to our discipline we can now focus on our priorities', 'We will have to continue to hold the line on spending', 'And I guarantee you this: the budget I submit, and any budget I will ultimately sign into law in June, will be truly balanced', 'But we have been working to get to this moment', 'To finally have New Jersey right side up, so we can focus on the big things', 'To challenge ourselves to be better', 'To strive for greatness', 'To ensure that every New Jerseyan is given the opportunity to have the life they want', 'So in my budget, I will fulfill a promise I made to all the people of New Jersey in 2009', 'Real relief from the heavy income tax burden that has strangled our families and forced many to move away', 'I propose to reduce income tax rates for each and every New Jerseyan', 'In every tax bracket', 'By 10% across the board', 'I also propose to fully restore the earned income tax credit for New Jersey’s working poor, which we were forced to cut during the dark days of 2010, when growth was gone and we had no money', 'Understand what this means – every New Jerseyan will get a cut in taxes', 'The working poor', 'The struggling middle class', 'The new college graduates getting their first job', 'The senior citizens who have already retired', 'The single mom', 'The job creators', 'The parents trying to afford to send their son or daughter to college', 'Everyone made the sacrifice', 'Everyone will share in the benefit', 'This will send a loud signal to New Jerseyans and would-be New Jerseyans, to families here now and families who have left, to businesses and job creators thinking of coming here and those who have struggled to stay: New Jersey is once again a place to plan your future, raise your family, grow your business and someday retire', 'The New Jersey Comeback has begun', 'Let’s be under no illusions – our job in turning New Jersey around is far from finished', 'We have improved our tax climate – but, there is much work to be done', 'For make no mistake – we are in a competition', 'A competition for jobs – among countries, yes, but also among states', 'In the last decade, two-thirds of all companies which moved jobs to a new location did not move to other countries – they moved from one state to another', 'Here in our region, our most direct competitors are making very different choices', 'In Connecticut, the governor has raised income tax rates on top earners and job creators', 'And New York last month enacted legislation to do the same', 'Other big states are also raising taxes', 'California’s governor has proposed to raise the top rate – already among the highest in the nation, by up to two percentage points', 'Illinois has already adopted a law to raise all income taxes by 67%', 'In this environment, the best way to compete is to show a different direction', 'Let others choose tax increases', 'We choose responsible tax cuts to give our overburdened citizens real relief', 'And to help New Jersey grow', 'Now some will argue, “Wait a minute: New York only raised taxes on the rich', 'Why not adopt Governor Cuomo’s package for New Jersey', '”', 'Here are the facts', 'If we enacted the exact same income tax rates put into law by New York last month, every person earning below $100,000 a year would face a tax increase – of anywhere from 150 to 200%', 'And, by the way, those earning a million dollars would get a tax cut', 'Is that what we want', 'Is that fairness', 'I don’t think so', 'An across the board tax cut is fair – every New Jersey taxpayer will benefit', 'Every New Jerseyan’s rates will go down', 'Every New Jerseyan will see relief', 'This is exactly what I was talking about when I took office; that the tough choices would lead to the right ones', 'Today, because we have put our fiscal house in order we can budget for our priorities and give tax relief to all of our people', 'Tax relief that will lead to better lives for our citizens and more jobs for our state', 'Job number two is to reform our education system – to strengthen our schools', 'Over the course of the last year, since outlining my proposals from this podium, I have worked with this legislature – on a bipartisan basis – to put in front of you a package of bills that will address the biggest challenges facing public education in New Jersey', 'We have had a year to debate, discuss and deliberate', 'Now, in 2012, it is time to act', 'New Jersey, in so many ways, is blessed', 'The majority of our schoolchildren continue to perform well, above most other states, on national student assessment tests', 'New Jersey has so many great teachers producing so many great students', 'Too many in the educational establishment, however, use that very real success as a camouflage for abject failure elsewhere in New Jersey', 'To use the success of others as an excuse to block change for those we are failing is not only wrong, it is immoral', 'Too many of our schools are failing our children, and they have been failing for far too long', 'We live in a time when educational attainment and economic success are correlated as never before', 'That is a good thing', 'It means that for this generation of Americans, what you can achieve will be driven not by who you know, but by what you know', 'You need to look only at the recent Harvard/Columbia study of 2', '5 million students over 20 years in America', 'Its independent research supports what I told you from my heart, from this podium, one year ago', 'Great teachers have a more significant impact on their student’s future success than average ones', 'Even more importantly, average teachers have an even greater effect on their students when they replace underperforming teachers', 'Research that confirms our own common sense', 'Tenure reform will lead to even greater student achievement because replacing underperforming teachers with even an average teacher raises each classroom’s lifetime earnings by over a quarter of a million dollars', 'Let’s act on real tenure reform now', 'Let’s replace despair with hope in every classroom in New Jersey', 'Because I believe it is obscene to be satisfied', 'When the chance for a life filled with hope and opportunity is determined not by how hard you are willing to work but by where you happen to live', 'Not by your intelligence, but by your zip code', 'Let’s face it: more money does not necessarily lead to a better education', 'Today, in Newark, we spend $23,000 per student for instruction and services', 'But only 23% of ninth graders who enter high school this year will receive high school diplomas in four years', 'Asbury Park is similar: per pupil costs, at almost $30,000 a year, are nearly 75% above the state average', 'But the dropout rate is almost 10 times the state average', 'And math S', 'A', 'T', 'scores lag the state average by 180 points', 'It is time to admit that the Supreme Court’s grand experiment with New Jersey children is a failure', '63% of state aid over the years has gone to the Abbott Districts and the schools are still predominantly failing', 'What we’ve been doing isn’t working for children in failing districts, it is unfair to the other 557 school districts and to our state’s taxpayers, who spend more per pupil than almost any state in America', 'Basic human decency and simple common sense say it is time for a different and better approach', 'The tools to give our children and their parents who are confronted with failing schools the chance for a better outcome are before you', 'They are embodied in bills which are bipartisan in nature and consistent with the reform advocated by President Obama, Education Secretary Duncan and most recently by New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo', 'My proposals reflect the input the administration has received at hundreds of meetings with educators, parents and professionals around the state', 'They are supported by independent research done at Harvard and Columbia', 'Most importantly, they reflect the intention we should all have: to put children first', 'The momentum to put children first began last week when you passed, and I traveled to Camden to sign, the Urban Hope Act', 'This new law will allow school districts in Newark, Camden and Trenton to partner with experts in the private sector to build and operate renaissance schools in these districts so in need of change', 'We have given some of our urban schools a signal that hope is on the way', 'I want to thank Senator Donald Norcross and Mayor Dana Redd for their bi-partisan support of this idea', 'You and I both know that this is a good start, but only a start', 'There is much more work to do', 'Here is what I propose:', '• First, reform tenure – by measuring teacher effectiveness, both with professional observation, and objective, quantifiable measures of student achievement – and then by giving tenure to those with strong evaluations, and taking it away from those whose ratings are unacceptably weak', 'We cannot ask parents to accept failure in teachers when their children’s lives hang in the balance;', '• Second, if layoffs are necessary remove the least effective teachers instead of just the most junior ones', 'It is time to end the system of “last in, first out,” which protects some of the worst and penalizes some of the best;', '• Third, pay teachers more when they are assigned to a failing school or to teach a difficult subject', 'Compensation should be designed to attract and retain effective teachers where we need them most;', '• Fourth, end forced placements', 'Teachers should not be assigned to schools without the mutual consent of the teacher and the principal', 'If an acceptable placement can’t be found in 12 months, the school district should have the right to place the teacher on permanent unpaid leave;', '• Fifth, we should reform our process for authorizing charter schools to attract the best operators to New Jersey, to streamline the process for the best performers, to focus on our failing school districts and to encourage innovation', 'We must give parents and children in failing schools an alternative; and', '• Last, and perhaps most importantly, establish tax credits to provide scholarships for low income students in the worst-performing schools in the state to enable them to attend a better school, either out of the district or a private school', 'Opportunity should not be offered to only those in an excellent school district or with parents who have the money to release their children from the prison that is a failing school', 'Let’s pass the opportunity scholarship act now', 'These are not radical reforms; they are common sense', 'They are not rash; they are long overdue', 'And they are not luxuries which can afford to languish for another six months or another year; they are essential for New Jersey’s success', 'I have a message that is not from me, but from the single mom in Newark, and the struggling parents in Camden, as well as the employers in our state: education reform has waited long enough', '***', 'New Jersey is one of America’s most diverse states', 'This means we have diverse problems, but also diverse opportunities', 'It means we must build the skills and improve the opportunities for many types of people, from all backgrounds and all walks of life', 'And it means we must work in multiple ways to improve the quality of life for everyone', 'Creating jobs and fixing the schools are probably the two most important ways to do that, but there are other steps we can take as well to improve the quality of life in New Jersey', 'This leads me to job number three', 'We need to reclaim our inner cities, respond to underserved regions, and engage our most vulnerable citizens', 'A few months ago, I hosted a town hall meeting in Union City with Senator Brian Stack', 'A woman from Newark was there', 'A mother', 'A neighbor', 'A concerned citizen', 'That day, she asked me a very direct question – and actually, I believe it was a question for all of us', 'She said, “I just wonder if the amount of violence, the amount of shootings, the amount of murders that take place in the City of Newark', 'I just wonder sometimes if it bothers you like it bothers us', 'Particularly the mothers who have lost their children', '”', 'And she ended her question with a plea', '‘Help us,’ she said, ‘Help us', '’ Well, that woman was Cassandra Dock', 'And I met with her and her neighbors', 'She is here in this chamber today', 'I ask all of you to send a message that in New Jersey we are creating a place where everyone is given the opportunity to live the life they want', 'I ask all of you to join me in saying to Cassandra', 'Yes, we will help you', 'Here is one example: we can only improve our quality of life by keeping the most violent criminals off the streets', 'So, I ask you to approve my bail reform package, which would mirror the federal system', 'It would keep offenders with a history of violence who are a danger to our communities in jail until the time of their trial, instead of releasing them into society to prey on the public', 'This may require a constitutional amendment but it is reform that is long overdue', 'Do you know that if a person is arrested with a long record of violence we cannot detain that person in jail pending trial', 'We must release that person, regardless of how dangerous they are to potential witnesses against them or innocent members of our society', 'Let us amend our bail laws to allow judges to consider the factor of dangerousness to our communities before we release a violent person back on to the street to maim or kill while they await trial', 'This, too, is just simple common sense', 'At the same time, let us reclaim the lives of those drug offenders who have not committed a violent crime', 'By investing time and money in drug treatment – in an in-house, secure facility – rather than putting them in prison', 'Experience has shown that treating non-violent drug offenders is two-thirds less expensive than housing them in prison', 'And more importantly – as long as they have not violently victimized society – everyone deserves a second chance, because no life is disposable', 'I am not satisfied to have this as merely a pilot project; I am calling for a transformation of the way we deal with drug abuse and incarceration in every corner of New Jersey', 'So today I ask this Legislature and the Chief Justice to join me in this commitment that no life is disposable', 'I propose mandatory treatment for every non-violent offender with a drug abuse problem in New Jersey, not just a select few', 'It will send a clear message to those who have fallen victim to the disease of drug abuse – we want to help you, not throw you away', 'We will require you to get treatment', 'Your life has value', 'Every one of God’s creations can be redeemed', 'Everyone deserves a second chance', '***', 'These are the big things I’d like us to focus on in 2012', 'These are my priorities', 'We know in our hearts that we represent some of the toughest, the most direct and honest people in America', 'A group of people who are destined for great things if we just give them the opportunity', 'But we also know that for too many years these same people were depressed about what New Jersey had become', 'Our leaders disappointed us in many different ways', 'Promises were made that weren’t even attempted to be kept', 'Our economy suffocated under the wet blanket of overtaxation, overspending, overborrowing and overregulation', 'Our education systems failed those who needed it the most, and our leaders stood by and said, “be patient, and we’ll fix it', '” In popular culture, New Jersey had become a punch line, rather than a place of pride', 'What’s happened in the last two years', 'Over the last two years, New Jersey is now seen around the country once again, not exclusively as the butt of late night jokes, but as a focus of the evening news and the Sunday talk shows', 'Why', 'Because, once again, we are leading America – by taking on the big things in public policy', 'We’ve known all along that our State is destined for great things', 'We just needed to give the people of our State the confidence that can come from watching leaders work together and from a state rising again all around them', 'To everyone in this room, to everyone watching in their home or listening in their car, I have one simple message: for the New Jersey Comeback to continue and grow, we must all come together', 'This obligation is not just mine and it is not just Kim’s', 'It is not just Steve’s or Sheila’s, not just Tom’s or Jon’s', 'The New Jersey Comeback is not about what happens in Trenton alone', 'All of you are in this too', 'Our wins and losses are your wins and losses', 'Our successes and failures are your successes and failures', 'The New Jersey Comeback didn’t start just here and it won’t be sustained just here', 'The New Jersey Comeback is yours, too', 'And so I say to all of you, regardless of where you are, regardless of what region of our State you come from, regardless of what political party you call home, you have had a stake in what has happened over the last two years, and you have contributed to making it happen', 'Now is not the time to stop, now is the time to double down', 'Now is not the time to put the brakes on New Jersey’s growth', 'Now it is the time to put the foot down harder on the accelerator', 'Now is not the time to turn back', 'Now is the time to make New Jersey greatness a reality again', 'That is what the next two years of my governorship will be dedicated to every day', 'We have climbed out of the hole that was left to us – together', 'Now it is time to raise the great flag of the State of New Jersey as high as we can – together', 'I cannot do it alone', 'Republicans cannot do it alone', 'Democrats cannot do it alone', 'Because, as Martin Luther King once said, “We may have come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now', '”', 'We must do this together in every town, every city and every county across our state', 'If you are ready to join that fight with me in the next two years as you have in the last two years, we will be here two years from now looking at a state that once again is a leader for a rejuvenated America', 'If you are willing to join that fight, so am I – on your behalf', 'That is what you elected me to do', 'And that is the solemn commitment I make to you again today', 'Thank you, God bless you, God bless America and God bless the great State of New

around\", '(END VIDEO CLIP)', 'WALLACE: General, what do you think of what Senator Paul is doing, forcing the expiration of this program', \"HAYDEN: I think it's really unfortunate\", \"There's a bit

we will go without that access for, what, 72 or 96 hours', \"It probably won't make a difference, but then again, it might\", \"WALLACE: So you're troubled by it\", 'HAYDEN: Yeah', 'WALLACE: On the other hand, does Senator Paul have a point, because three weeks ago a court of appeals ruled that the Patriot Act does not authorize this kind of bulk metadata collection and that the program, the specific program, is illegal', 'HAYDEN: Right', \"So, Senator Paul claimed that it's unconstitutional\", 'Now, the controlling legal authority there is a 1979 court decision that says, indeed, metadata is not, repeat, not constitutionally protected', 'We have no reasonable expectation of privacy there', 'The second argument', 'WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait', 'Quickly explain that', 'What the court ruled was that if I make a call to you, perhaps the conversation between us is protected', 'HAYDEN: Absolutely', 'WALLACE: But the fact that my number calls your number, since this would go on a phone record, which I think in that case was thrown out in the mail and somebody could pick up, the fact that this number called that number for how many minutes, that that is not constitutionally protected', 'HAYDEN: Exactly right', \"And so, we're not talking about a constitutional matter\", 'Now, we may be talking about a legal matter here', 'The Congress has the ability to resolve that', 'They could actually pass language that makes it quite clear that the current method of collecting metadata is indeed what Congress intends', \"The court held that the current language doesn't support the current activity\", 'But Congress has it within its power and its authority to fix that', \"WALLACE: So, basically, the court was saying, this law doesn't allow that, so pass another law if you want to\", 'HAYDEN: Exactly', 'WALLACE: All right', \"Let's assume, and it seems likely, all these programs expire at midnight, if only for a few days\", \"The NSA's collection of phone records goes dark, so does the roving wiretap authority to track a target as he switches phones, perhaps one phone to another to try to avoid detection, and also, the lone wolf provision, which allows investigating individuals who are not linked to a terror group\", 'Again, you said it could, it might not', 'How seriously is the former head of the NSA, former head of the CIA, how seriously does this jeopardize our national security', 'Is the country potentially in greater danger of a terrorist attack because we will not have these capabilities', 'HAYDEN: Absolutely', \"And why would a reasonable people take off the table tools that I believe are lawful, and around which there's already a political consensus\", 'If the vote goes forward, Chris, most of these things go on', 'Why would we give up things the professionals say, keep us safer', 'WALLACE: Why', 'Explain, if you will, why the country is potentially in greater danger', 'HAYDEN: Sure', 'Look, these are all threads, , these are all parts of a fabric', 'None of these are silver bullets', \"And that's one of the problems people like me have in explaining this to the American people\", 'Because, you know, intelligence is fundamentally boring', \"It's not what you see on evening television\", \"It's just piece by piece, thread by thread\", \"You're giving up threads\", 'It may not make a difference for a while', 'But then again, it might', \"And over the longer term, I'm willing to wager, Chris, that it will, indeed, make a difference\", \"As you pointed out in your setup, we're more at risk today from internal actors than we have been at any time since 9/11\", 'WALLACE: But there seems to be a debate about how effective and how useful these programs are', 'Let me put some things on the screen', \"A recent report by the Justice Department's inspector general said FBI agents could not identify any major case developments that came from bulk data collection\", 'And the Privacy and Civil Liberties oversight board, an independent agency created by Congress, found no instances of abuse of the program, but also no instances where it stopped a terrorist attack', \"Now, you say, well, it's a thread\", \"It's not the silver bullet\", \"But that isn't exactly the good housekeeping seal of approval\", \"HAYDEN: No, and when you had me in here a few months ago, Chris, and we were talking about CIA's renditions, detentions, interrogations, I have the same issue\", 'Show me where it was a silver bullet', \"And I'm saying it doesn't work that way\", \"I mean we seem to get credit only if we get, because of one or another of these programs, we get to tackle with terrorists on the rooftop just as he's about to chamber a round\", 'How about we have a complex intelligence picture created that allows us to take action on the financier, months if not years ahead of that late last-second attempt to kill us', 'WALLACE: OK, so the House has passed the USA Freedom Act, which basically would change the program', 'So instead of the government holding all of these records, the telephone companies who the calls were made on, would hold the records, and then the government would have to go to the phone company with the warrant to get information about a specific series of contacts', 'Could you live with that', 'HAYDEN: Well, clearly, Chris, that is the best political solution out there right now', 'It is not the best operational solution because if it were, this is how we would have organized the thing in the first place', \"So, we're going to take a bit of a leap of faith with the USA Freedom Act, that the telecoms will be able to keep the data, that they will keep it because they're not required by law to keep it, and they'll keep it long enough, and none of them keep it as long as NSA keeps it, and that we'll be able to query the database across multiple entities with an effectiveness and accuracy that matches what it is we can do now against a single database\", \"So, if you're asking me in a perfect world, what would I do, I'd reauthorize the Patriot Act\", 'Can we live with this', 'I understand the politics matter, probably', \"WALLACE: Well, you know, it's interesting because I was talking to some Senate leaders yesterday\", 'And they talked about the possibility', 'We know Mitch McConnell has been against this', \"He wants to just reauthorize the Patriot Act, but bowing, perhaps, to political reality, he's considering, yes, this, the Freedom Act, but with amendments\", \"And some of the amendments that are being talked about, one would be that the president would have to certify that it will work, that, in fact, it isn't just a theoretical issue, but if the NSA or the CIA wants to query AT&T, that they'll be able to get the information\", 'And then the other is, as you point out, the U', 'S', \"Freedom Act doesn't require a company to actually hold onto these records\", 'And the concern is that a phone company might market it and say, hey, guess what, you sign up with us, we are not going to keep your records', 'HAYDEN: Yeah, family, friends and nobody else', 'WALLACE: So, I mean, do you think that those -- how important do you think those kinds of amendments are', 'HAYDEN: I think they would be very useful', \"As I said before, the way it's currently constructed is a leap of faith, an act of faith, that the companies will do this, and technologically we will be able to do it as well as we do it now\", \"I would like to have the administration Mike Rogers, the current director of NSA, come in in a fix period of time and candidly tell the Congress, here is how it worked as well, here is how it's not working as well\", \"It's what we used to do\", 'And then, Chris, I get it', 'We get to draw this line all the time between liberty and security', \"But let's do it based on the facts\", 'How much security are we giving up for how much more liberty', \"In a program in which you've already mentioned, there have been no abuses\", 'WALLACE: OK, finally', \"And I've got a little over a minute left\", 'I want to move briefly to ISIS, which is on the march, as you well know, both in Iraq and in Syria', 'You said recently that you think that the U', 'S', 'military is under-resourced and overregulated', 'Explain', 'HAYDEN: Sure', 'We have got about 3,000 people there', 'I think most people think the right number to do what it is the president has laid out, degrade and defeat ISIS, is probably 5,000 to 10,000', 'But more important than the numbers are the rules of engagement', \"We don't go forward\", \"We don't embed with the Iraqi military\", \"We go below the brigade level, which is a very high echelon, we don't have tactical air control party's forward, and we've not made very frequent use of our Special Operations forces at all\", \"WALLACE: So, you'd put them more in the fight\", \"HAYDEN: Unfortunately, that's more at risk\", 'I get that', 'But I would put them more in the fight', 'Chris, the president has declared that defeating ISIS is a strategic interest of the United States', \"WALLACE: And based on what you've seen from this president so far, what do you think is the likely about that he'll, one, increase the number of U\", 'S', 'troops in Iraq and, two, put them in a more dangerous, vulnerable, but also more effective fighting position', 'HAYDEN: I think the

enough that the delayed impact of economic recovery has reached families who depend on them', 'There are 43', '6 million people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the

boosted benefits even more', 'The Obama administration also announced that it was pushing to expand eligibility, in part on the theory that expanding the food stamp program is also good for the economy because the money is quickly spent', 'Of course, the economic aftershocks of the Great Recession, which was in full force before Obama took office, has a lot to do with the increase', 'There

regulations', 'We have in the past looked deeply at the methodological issues concerning this $2 trillion estimate, which can be found in previous fact checks from 2014 and 2011', 'But there is an important element missing in the use of this somewhat sketchy figure — the benefit side of the analysis', 'Every regulation has costs — but also benefits', 'Look at cars, for example', 'Seat belts are

frozen in banks around the world, but $150 billion is the high estimate of the money that could be received', 'The Treasury Department says the figure is in the range of $100 to $125 billion, but the usual liquid assets would only be about $50 billion, as the rest of the assets are either obligated in illiquid projects (such as over 50 projects with China) that cannot be monetized quickly, if at all, or are composed of outstanding loans to Iranian entities that cannot repay them', 'For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion', 'Reasonable people can

who he was, but he surpassed them all because of who he became\", '(END VIDEO CLIP)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And with that, let me bring in senators John Kerry and Orrin Hatch', 'Welcome to you both', 'And you both spoke movingly Friday night as a celebration for Senator Kennedy', \"And I want to begin with you, Senator Kerry, because you called this last year of Senator Kennedy's life the sweetest of seasons\", 'And I wonder if you could share a little bit of what you learned and saw of your friend in his last year', 'KERRY: Well, he -- he was so graceful, George', 'And courageous', 'And I think the most important thing is that he was able to see and feel the love and affection and the accomplishment of his lifetime', 'So that in the end when he went, he was truly ready and at peace', 'And I think there is a beauty in that', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And that was one of the themes really of this whole week', 'And, Senator Hatch, you cracked everybody up Friday night when you talked about your friend, Senator Kennedy, and especially when you talked about those old days sometimes when he was feeling no pain, in your words, on the Senate Floor', 'But you spun it out into a story of redemption', 'HATCH: Yes', 'Actually, Teddy was a very religious person', 'And, you know, when Vicki came into his life, it changed a lot of things', 'Of course, we had some experiences before that as well that were very redemptive and helpful', \"And all I can say is that the latter part of Teddy's life was really, really tremendous\", 'And I enjoyed being with him, you know', 'We were like fighting brothers', 'I mean, we would go at each other and he would walk up to me and throw his arms around me and say, how did I do', '(LAUGHTER)', 'HATCH: And I used to just laugh', 'And I used to really rib him and give him a rough time too', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: You said fighting brothers, and I couldn't help but notice you and Senator Kerry already talking about health care right before we went\", \"KERRY: Yes, listen, we're going to get Orrin\", 'Orrin is going to be our man', 'He is going to be the go-to Republican', 'He is going to do what Ted Kennedy would have done', 'Right, Orrin', \"HATCH: All they have -- all they have to do is just start thinking straight, and I'll be right there with them, I'll tell you\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: But that's the big question\", 'You say, do what Ted Kennedy would have done', 'And you know, this has been a big part of the debate this week', 'In fact, Secretary Sebelius engaged it just a couple of days ago', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)', 'SEBELIUS: The best possible legacy is to pass health reform this year and have a bill that President Obama could sign', \"And hopefully at every step along the way, they'll ask themselves what would Teddy do\", 'And move it forward', '(END VIDEO CLIP)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: But, Senator Kerry, there already is a big debate over what would Teddy do', \"I mean, I think a lot of liberals and progressives saying he would fight for this public health insurance option and, you know, if that -- if you didn't have that, it wasn't worth doing\", \"Others look at it, and I think you may be one of them who say, no, the lesson of Senator is that he got what he could get, the perfect couldn't be the enemy of the good\", 'KERRY: Well, Ted would put facts on the table and he would put the reality of life for a lot of Americans on the table', \"And the reality of life is that we have over 87 million Americans every year during some portion of the year who don't have insurance\", \"And almost 50 million who all of the time don't have insurance\", 'It costs them and costs America an enormous amount of money', 'We are not managing an efficient health care system', 'And so we are delivering worse health care for more money than many other nations in the world', 'Now Orrin knows that', 'We know we can do a better job of providing health care to Americans', 'And what Teddy would do is he would fight for that public option, because he believes -- believed that the public option, as I do, is an effective -- the best way possible to be able to reduce the', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: But he could count votes as well', 'KERRY: Now let me just finish', 'STEPHANOPOULOS:', \"and the votes don't seem to be there\", 'KERRY: Let me just finish', 'Let me finish', \"He would fight for it, and he would do everything in his power to get it, just like he did for the minimum wage or like he did for children's health care, et cetera\", \"But if he didn't see the ability to be able to get it done, he would not throw the baby out with the bathwater\", 'He would not say no to anything because we have to reduce the cost', 'We have to make these changes', 'And he would find the best way forward', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: So he wouldn't agree with those like Howard Dean who say it's not worth doing if you don't have the public health insurance option\", 'KERRY: I think there is an enormous amount, George -- oh, here is what Teddy would do', \"He would say, I'm going to fight the fight, and if and when we get to the point that we can't get there, we'll see whether or not we can do enough to make good happen out of this\", \"And you can't make that measurement today\", 'We have to go down that road', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: You said, earlier this year, Senator Hatch, that Senator Kennedy was really missed in the negotiations, because of his ability to speak to progressives and reach out to Republicans', 'What about going forward right now', 'Who can fill that void and is there a deal to be had here', 'HATCH: One thing that Kennedy had, he could bring together all of the base groups of the Democratic Party', \"They wouldn't take him on once he made up his mind\", 'And as somebody who over the last 33 years passed almost every health care bill that works, many of them with Ted Kennedy, in fact, most of them with Ted Kennedy', 'Everything from orphan drugs to the three AIDS bills to the CHIP bill, you can just name it, you know, even people with disabilities', 'I mean, we worked on all of those together', \"In every case, he fought as hard as he could, like John has said here, but when he recognized that, you know, he couldn't get everything that he wanted, but he could get a good bill by working with the other side\", 'And making through compromise, he would always come through', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Did you think he would move in that direction now', 'HATCH: I have no doubt about it', 'I mean, if he was here', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it doable now', 'HATCH:', \"I don't think we'd be in the mess we're in right now\", \"And look, Ted was the leading liberal in the Senate -- in the whole Congress, as far as I'm concerned\", 'And others come very close to him, like John here', \"I mean, very good people, but you know, let's be honest about it, the people out there are very concerned\", \"They don't want a Washington-run government plan, it's just that simple\", 'And I think that is showing up everywhere throughout America', \"When Medicare is $38 trillion in unfunded liability, and then they want to take $400 billion or $500 billion out of Medicare, I mean, come on, this doesn't make sense\", 'And Teddy would have recognized that', 'And look, I -- we used to get in tremendous fights, he and I, but we would always come together in the end', 'And it was always because both of us were willing to go to the center', 'And sometimes he would go to the center-right', 'I mean, CHIP was a center-right bill', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: So what's going to\", '(CROSSTALK)', 'KERRY: Yes, but one of the things that Teddy would make clear, and I want to now, is that no one is talking about a government-run, Washington-based health care plan', 'That is not what people are talking about', 'So if we can get a reality onto the table, which Orrin is usually pretty good at doing, we can have a good conversation here', \"I'm convinced we're going to do this\", 'I believe better judgment is going to prevail', \"I think we're going to come back, begin this discussion anew in a way that we ought to\", \"And I think we're\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: But let me draw out something', 'KERRY:', 'going to get it done', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats and Republicans, if you look at -- across the broad (INAUDIBLE), have agreed on a couple of components of the bill', 'KERRY: Right', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: These insurance reforms, you can't be denied health care if you're sick\", \"You can't get thrown out if you're sick\", 'A lot of Democrats, Republicans say that maybe we should have this individual mandate, to require people to buy insurance, to couple that with reforms', 'Bill Bradley points out today, I think it was in The New York Times, that, you know, maybe they should include some malpractice reform as well', 'Are they -- those three things the building blocks of a deal', 'HATCH: Yes, they really are', 'You know, Democrats have been unwilling to take on the personal injury lawyers', 'And look, there are cases that really deserve huge rewards, huge judgments', \"We've got to find some way of getting rid of the frivolous cases, and most of them are\", 'Most of them are brought', \"KERRY: And that's doable, most definitely\", \"HATCH: Yes, and that's doable\", 'Most of them are brought to -- you know, to get the defense costs', 'They know that once they bring them, the insurance companies are going to have to pay their defense costs rather than take a chance at a runaway jury', \"But it's not just that\", \"It's the other elements you've been talking about too\", 'Those are three very important', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And then if you add some subsidies to that to move towards covering more people', 'KERRY: Yes, which I think we have some -- actually, I think we have some flexibility on as to sort of the rate and manner in which you do that', 'So I think that there are ways to do this, George', \"As a member of the Finance Committee, I've been part of this discussion, though many of us would like to see it broadened in some ways\", \"I'd like -- I mean, you know, my question to Orrin and to others is, you know, who is the Republican\", 'Who are the Republicans, plural, who are prepared to step up and do as Ted Kennedy would have done here', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: You were part of the negotiations earlier this year but then stepped away', 'Are you ready to come back', 'ORRIN: Sure', \"I've always been ready to do that\", 'But look, you talk about an individual mandate', 'The problem with an individual mandate is that the people who are really hurt the most are those on the lower end of the wage spectrum', 'They either lose their jobs, a cutback in pay, or the company goes overseas', \"Once you start doing that -- because the theory behind that is that you've penalized the company if they don't provide insurance for their people by having them have it surcharged\", \"And look, let's just be honest about it, it's a very difficult thing to do\", 'There are some ways we could do this, none -- both sides', 'KERRY: Actually, Orrin', 'HATCH: Both sides are arguing for insurance reform', \"That's not the issue\", 'The issue is, how do we put all of these elements together', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me switch to', '(CROSSTALK)', \"KERRY: The truth is we're doing that very effectively in Massachusetts\", 'Ted Kennedy was part of making that happen -- a key part of making that happen', 'We went from 10 percent of our folks who had no insurance down to 2', '6 percent, the lowest percentage of uninsured in the nation', 'And it has worked', 'And companies have not left', 'Companies, in fact, are delighted with the better distribution of costs in the state', 'So what we need to do is have people who want to sit down and not be bound by ideology, not be the prisoners of a political strategy, but who want to get health care done based on the best way to get it', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me move to', 'KERRY:', 'done', \"If we did that, we'd get it done\", 'HATCH: Can I make a point on that', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Very quickly', \"HATCH: You know, that's one of my points that I've been making, is that Utah is not Massachusetts, neither is any other state\", 'Massachusetts is having a very, very difficult time because of the costs involved in their program', 'But it is their right to do that', 'Utah has one of the best health care systems in the country, most people agree with that, as does Minnesota', 'Because -- and I think the demographics in each state are different', 'I think if we give some flexibility, we might be able to have a better -- a very good', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: We have to move on to another', 'HATCH:', 'health care system', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Another issue that', '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: OK', 'Let me move to another issue that came up earlier this week', 'The attorney general decided to investigate possible CIA abuses in the prisoner interrogation cases', 'And Vice President Cheney this morning has blasted that decision by the attorney general', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)', 'DICK CHENEY, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT: The approach of the Obama administration should be to come to those people who were involved in that policy and say, how did you do it', 'What were the keys to keeping the country safe over that period of time', \"Instead, they're out there now threatening to disbar the lawyers who gave us the legal opinions, threatening, contrary to what the president originally said, they were going to go out and investigate the CIA personnel who carried out those investigations\", '(END VIDEO CLIP)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: He called it an outrageous and possibly dangerous act', \"KERRY: Well, Dick Cheney has shown through the years, frankly, a disrespect for the Constitution, for sharing of information with Congress, respect for the law, and I'm not surprised that he is upset about this\", \"The Obama administration has no intention -- I think the president himself has been unbelievably bending in the direction of trying to be careful about what happens to national security, protecting our national security interests, being very sensitive about the CIA's prerogatives and needs and so forth\", 'And in fact, I think there is a little bit of a tension between the White House itself and the lawyers in the Justice Department as they see the law and as what their obligation is', \"And in a sense, that's good\", \"That's appropriate, because it shows that we have an attorney general who is not pursuing a political agenda, but who is doing what he believes the law requires him to do\", 'And we have an administration, on the other hand, that is balancing some of those other interests', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: The vice president also said that he believes that CIA officials who went outside the bounds of the guidelines they were given were justified', 'Do you agree with that', 'HATCH: There is a real question whether they went outside of the bounds that they were given at the time', \"Look, I -- as the longest- serving person in the Senate Intelligence Committee, I've got to tell you, we don't want to cripple our ability to be able, in very crucial times, to get the information we've got to have to save our country and to protect our people\", 'I think what Dick Cheney is arguing for -- and look, how can anybody argue that Cheney has been a great asset to the country in so many ways', 'He is a tough guy, there is no question', 'He differs from the so-called progressives in the Congress', 'And I really question, after all of the investigations were done, some prosecutions that were waged, and most of this material was decided not to go forward, to now go forward with this, I really question whether the attorney general is doing what is right', 'And look, the attorneys, maybe you can question the opinions, but they were sincere opinions', 'I know the attorneys involved', 'They were wonderful, wonderful', '(CROSSTALK)', 'HATCH:', 'lawyers who', 'STEPHANOPOULOS:', \"they're not going to be investigating that part\", \"HATCH: Well, they shouldn't investigate that part\", 'And nor should they be prosecuting people who acted under good faith following advice of the lawyers in the department', \"So, you know, and what they're doing is crippling the CIA where they're going to be unwilling to really take the risks that have to be taken during really crucial times\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: Afraid that's all we have time for today\", 'Gentlemen, thank you both very much for coming in this morning', 'KERRY: Thanks, good to be with you,

rewards cumulative effort, and the other two lives were cut short', 'History dealt Ted Kennedy a bad hand', 'That is, he became Mr', 'Democrat and Mr', 'Liberal at a time when liberalism just began to recede', 'His career is a little bit like that of Robert Taft, who for a generation was Mr', 'Republican', 'The Republicans loved him, applauded him, and never nominated him for president', 'In 1980, they refused to nominate Ted Kennedy', 'In 1984, they nominated the last New Deal Democrat to be nominated, that was Walter Mondale, and he lost 49 states', \"In '88, they began moving away with Dukakis\", \"In '92, they finally elected a really different Democrat\", 'DONALDSON: Well, you know, Eddie McCormick was right in 1962', 'His candidacy was a joke, except for the fact that his brother was president of the United States, and Kennedys in Massachusetts were very important', 'And for the first 15, maybe 20 years, I think what he did in the Senate was not something that will be his legacy', 'It is the things he did outside of the Senate that people remember', \"But it was liberating to lose that nomination fight to Jimmy Carter, get that monkey off his back, and the next few years, particularly when he married Vicki, I think the whole body of Ted Kennedy's work has to be judged\", 'And in judging the whole body, I think I agree with George', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: E', 'J', \", Ted Kennedy himself put it in context, in this remarkable scene -- I don't know how many saw it -- but last night at Arlington Cemetery, Cardinal McCarrick read the letter, parts of the letter that Ted Kennedy wrote to the pope earlier this summer, and he talked about how he wasn't a perfect person, but he also seemed to use his Catholic faith and say that his public career had -- was rooted in his faith and an expression of his faith\", \"DIONNE: You know, we Catholics believe profoundly in the power of confession, and in a way, part of that letter was Ted Kennedy's last confession, an acknowledgement of sin\", 'What he really did is he got the last word at his own funeral, and it was an extraordinary manifesto in part', 'And I think he was -- his Catholicism was very important to him', 'He was a serious churchgoer, and it was not only a way to make a public case for his kind of liberal Catholicism, it was also a way of lobbying Pope Benedict', \"And it's fascinating that pope\", '(CROSSTALK)', \"DIONNE: Yes, and that it's interesting, Pope Benedict's latest encyclical was a powerful call for social justice that Ted Kennedy would have endorsed almost to the last comma\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: He did mention abortion, of course, in that letter', 'DIONNE: He did slightly (ph)', 'He said we want a protection for Catholic doctors within the health care plan',

'DIONNE: I was curious about that, as well', \"I think that it's possible that there's a head of state/head of state thing going on\", \"It's possible that the pope didn't want to send a signal of endorsement, because they did disagree on abortion\", \"But that's -- I'm not sure why the pope didn't write personally\", \"DONALDSON: I was disappointed, although it's not my place to criticize the pope\", 'DIONNE: Although this was a very warm reply done in the third person', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me bring in Liz here', 'Another contradiction of Ted Kennedy, which we saw played out this week', 'He was the Democrat who in the country Republicans loved to hate, but you saw so much here inside the Capitol so many Republicans loved him', 'CHENEY: Well, I think that goes to sort of what he was like as a man off the floor of the Senate', 'I think obviously, there were some very bitter partisan debates that people had with him, but I too was struck by the eulogies you heard by people like Senator Hatch and others, Senator McCain, as well', 'And I think also, you know, what he showed was sort of the example of a man who dedicated his professional life to service the nation', \"And, you know, I think at a time that we're in now for the country, it is an example and I think it's an example for young people\", 'I hope it serves as an example for young people, sort of the nobility of public office', 'And I think you have to admire his passion and his perseverance even though many of us, myself included, you know, disagree strongly with him on his politics', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, speaking of the young people, you were at the funeral yesterday', \"You also covered Senator Kennedy in the Senate, and it was another striking moment, not only the sons but also the nieces, the nephews, the grandchildren using the litany to talk about Ted Kennedy's public works\", 'IFILL: You know, I served on the board -- I serve on the board of the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School, and Senator Kennedy was on that board obviously as is his niece', 'And he not only reached out to the children of his family, he also spent a lot of time every time he visited Harvard with the students who wanted to be future public servants', 'Not just people who wanted to be politicians, people who volunteered in local schools in Cambridge and people who do amazing things and that would come to Washington and intern in various offices, Republicans, Democrats, you name it', 'And he was very invested in that in the name of his brother and in the name of his family', 'But it was also an example of how Ted Kennedy, and I noticed this yesterday in all of the eulogies and all weekend long, he was known as the great lion, the great liberal lion', 'And he was that', 'But he was liberal in a way that Jack Kemp used to say he was a Democrat and that was a little \"L\" and Jack Kemp was a little \"D', '\"', 'In that he believed in expansiveness', 'When he defined civil rights, he thought civil rights applied to people who were disabled and to people who wanted to be married who are same sex and he thought that liberalism applied to people who needed to vote at the age of 18 and young girls who wanted to compete in athletics', 'He had a hand in all of these things, so very expansive', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Expansive, George, but you point out that era may be over and I want to pick up on the conversations that Senators Kerry and Hatch had', 'Is there any way that anyone, any senator can fill that void, that niche', \"WILL: I don't think so, partly because this was a product of longevity and the enormous niceness of the man\", 'People just liked Ted Kennedy', \"The funny thing is what's happened in this August it seems to me is the country has indicated a bifurcated mind, great affection for Ted Kennedy\", 'But at the same time, they are having second thoughts about this president and this president is the first Ted Kennedy Democrat elected since Roosevelt',

\"Also, the debate over this attorney general's investigation into the CIA\", 'But as we go to the break, let me share my favorite interview with Ted Kennedy', 'It was just before the Democratic Convention in 2004 and the senator was walking me around the grounds at Hyannisport pointing out the house where his brother Jack first learned he would be president, and I asked Kennedy how much he regretted not winning the White House himself', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)', 'KENNEDY: My pursuit is public service, not the constant pursuit of the presidency', 'I said that almost 25 years ago, so I have

significant factor over the period of the last 20 years when the Congress and the country is focused on this issue is that what we need is one kind of a program for all Americans, rich and poor, and that ought to be quality health for all Americans\", '(END VIDEO CLIP)', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: Ted Kennedy saying he's not going to accept Richard Nixon's health plan in 1972\", 'Years later, he called it

time', 'WILL: Conservatives spend our lives saying there is a reason things are as they are', \"There are vast forces out there and there's a reason why health care is very difficult to do\", 'WILL: Newt Gingrich has a piece in the Washington Post this morning saying since the Second World War, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton had lower poll ratings than Barack Obama now has after seven months', 'If that is true, it is because the independents are leaving him, and more important, the elderly are', 'In 2008 -- and everyone in Congress knows this number -- in 2008, 40 percent of the votes were cast by voters 50 years old or older', 'By 2030, when the baby boomers have all retired, there will be more Americans 65 years old or older than there are Americans 18 or under', 'This is the politics of gerontocracy', \"And what we're learning is that those to whom health care is most important are most wary of this program\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: You know what's interesting, Gwen, is that Senator Kennedy is one of those Democrats who would have had the most credibility with senior citizens, could sell the deal if that's indeed -- if one did indeed come together\", \"IFILL: Yes, and there's -- there's a big debate going on about whether Senator Kennedy actually had the magic wand and could have influenced the direction of this debate\", \"I don't think that's resolved at all\", \"But it's also clear that people are reaching for something\", 'There was a great deep breath taken this August', 'There were, you know, no shark attacks and, you know, no hurricanes that actually',

been -- wouldn't have gotten attention\", \"There would have been unhappy people, but it wouldn't have been so vitriolic in the way it did, consume so much time\", \"Ted Kennedy's death made people stop and pay attention to something else for a few days\", \"Now, we'll see what happens when everybody comes back to town, back to school, in Washington, after Labor Day, and whether they start from a different spot or whether everything keeps going downhill\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, and that's the -- I was, you know, Sam, watching these two senators there, it seems like there's this sense that

may just have to push it through with reconciliation in the Senate, meaning\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats only', \"DONALDSON: Yes, the Democrats only, because, if they don't get something that is meaningful -- Ted Kennedy is right; Ronald Reagan, the same way, you take what you can get from the standpoint of half a loaf, rather than nothing whatsoever\", \"But half a loaf, in this case, if it doesn't produce the goals, particularly of reducing the increase in health care expenses, isn't good enough\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And, E', 'J', \", there's a problem with this whole Democrats-only strategy -- a couple of problems\", \"Number one, now there's one fewer Democrat in the Senate\", \"It's unclear whether Massachusetts will be able to fill -- will change the law to be able to fill that seat\", 'But also, and I guess this is the deeper problem, the Democrats that you need to get to a majority want a bipartisan bill', 'They want the cover of Republicans on the bill', \"DIONNE: Well, first of all, I'm so glad George mentioned Medicare because it is an extraordinary conservative hypocrisy you're seeing now that Republicans are emerging as the great defenders of Medicare, a program they once tried to cut\", 'They say they hate socialized medicine', 'Medicare is socialized medicine', \"So it's a really remarkable point we've gotten to here\", \"The fact is that the Democrats, I think, know what a huge price they paid as a party when Bill Clinton's health care bill went down in 1994\", \"And I think, from left to right in that party, or left to center, they know what a catastrophe it will be if they can't pass a health care bill\", 'Yes, there are some technical problems in getting it through with less than 60 votes, but, you know, as Donald Rumsfeld might say, you go with -- you have to live with the Republican Party you have, not the Republican Party you wish existed', \"And Republicans don't want to support this\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: More than -- I think that may be true, but do -- and I'm wondering if you're right about your analysis\", 'Are the Democrats', 'CHENEY: I have a view on that', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And I want to bring you in on it as well', '(LAUGHTER)', \"Are the Democrats who are for the public option now -- do you think they've absorbed the lesson you say you've absorbed, which is the consequence of failure is just too -- too deep\", 'DIONNE: See, I think the mistake President Obama made is sending mixed signals on the public options so early', 'I think he is for it', 'He should have defended it and described it', \"Right now, it's only an ideological debate\", \"We're not talking about the actual benefits it could produce in terms of cost -- saving money\", \"In the end, if he fights for it and it's clear that you can't get a bill without it, then I think liberals would go along, if you could massively increase coverage\", \"You've got to push it\", \"CHENEY: I think that, you know, there's a much bigger problem here\", \"I think you've got a situation where President Obama, who is supposed to be, sort of, the great communicator, the White House rolls him out for three town hall meetings over the course of the last several months, and on issue after issue where he's attempting to provide some comfort to the American people, you know, they're looking at focus groups and they're seeing that the American people want costs down\", 'So the president asserts that this -- these plans, which everyone has adopted, will in fact result in a cost cut', \"And then the CBO and now the OMB, also, in Peter Orszag's letter, have said that's not the case; in fact, we're going to increase the deficit\", 'On an issue like, will you be able to keep your own health insurance if you like it, the president is out there asserting, in these town halls, yes, you can keep your own health insurance', \"But then, in a conference call with liberal bloggers, when he's asked about a particular provision in the legislation that sounds like it wouldn't allow to you keep your own insurance, he has to admit he hasn't read the bill\", \"So there's a deeper problem here\", 'The American people are very', '(CROSSTALK)', 'CHENEY: Well, this was H', 'R', '3200 they were talking about', '(CROSSTALK)', \"CHENEY: But there's a deeper problem here, which is that the American people fundamentally are scared about, you know, whatever bill is being proposed, and they, sort of, look to their president, particularly one who has been such an effective communicator in the past, to be able to give them some comfort\", \"And when they see such a difference between the president's rhetoric and blanket assertions and the specifics in any of the pieces of legislation\", \"DONALDSON: You're right, in\", 'CHENEY:', 'I think it gives us some concern', 'DONALDSON: We talked about it before', 'This president, by July, should have said \"This is what we should do', 'You cats have been herding yourselves; now it\\'s time someone\\'s got to herd you; and this is what I think we should do; Move on that\" -- to his party', 'Be Franklin Roosevelt', 'Be a tough guy, no more Mr', 'nice guy',

he doesn't win on this one\", '(LAUGHTER)', \"IFILL: That's your opinion, Sam\", '(LAUGHTER)', \"My point is that he's making everybody unhappy\", 'The headline in The Washington Post today, the op-ed, which said, OK, we bought into the hope; where is the audacity', 'Liberals are not happy with him right now', 'Conservatives are not happy', 'What will be interesting to watch, after the holiday, is what is the line that he can force', '(CROSSTALK)', \"CHENEY: It's more than a technical problem, though\", 'You know, the White House is now facing a really tough choice, which is, are you going to not get anything on what the president has said is his central domestic policy issue, or are you going to push it through with the Democrats', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, and that's a -- that's a -- there's a tactical problem there\", 'Go ahead', \"DIONNE: Well, I was going to say, people are torn because they're always afraid that if government does the wrong thing, they're going to lose something\", 'But the conservatives won this debate in August because they focused on that', \"Everybody has forgotten what they don't like about the current health care system\", \"They don't like that people go bankrupt\", \"They don't like that you can be denied coverage because you have a pre- existing condition\", \"And Obama's task is to move the conversation back to, wait a minute, there's stuff here you don't like and we're going to fix it\", '(CROSSTALK)', \"CHENEY: That's right\", \"But what's happened, though, now -- sorry -- but what's happened is that people are realizing that what is being proposed, no matter what the bill is, is actually worse or will make things worse than things they don't like\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Those who have insurance are worried about that right now', 'WILL: First, on a point of order', '(LAUGHTER)', 'Brother E', 'J', 'says the Republicans are guilty of hypocrisy for now defending Medicare against cuts', 'The president is guilty of cognitive dissonance on Medicare', 'DIONNE: Which is worse', '(LAUGHTER)', 'WILL: He says to the elderly, fear not, Medicare is a government health program that works well', \"Next breath, he says, it's going broke and in deep trouble\", 'Now, which is it', \"DIONNE: Well, it's both\", \"I mean, in fact, you cannot sustain Medicare over the long haul, and he's trying to fix it\", '(CROSSTALK)', \"DONALDSON: Well, I tried to figure out why all of the elderly people, of which I am one, are against the government programs, since we're all in Medicare\", 'I had my aortic valve replaced -- thank you, taxpayers -- and I did pay some taxes', 'Over $100,000, I have managed to come up with 1,800 out of my pocket', \"Now we are also worried, apparently, that they will cut some of the benefits from Medicare to make up that, so I'd have to come up with $2,100\", '(CROSSTALK)', 'DONALDSON:', '$100,000', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And the way the White House tried to solve this problem was by reaching this deal with the pharmaceutical manufacturers where they would agree to', 'DONALDSON: Billy Tauzin', '(CROSSTALK) (LAUGHTER)', 'Billy Tauzin, the lobbyist for the pharmaceutical', '(CROSSTALK)', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: But that's the problem\", 'They got the agreement to fill this doughnut hole, which would affect a lot of seniors, but now the Democratic leaders in the Congress are backing away from that deal', \"IFILL: That's my point\", 'How exactly do you win a fight where everybody hates your ideas, where everybody hates your approach', 'WILL: Let me tell you how', '(CROSSTALK)',

'DIONNE:', 'what he wants to do', \"I think that, you know, between the Hillary Clinton approach, which was unbelievable detail, a 500-person group and zero, there's a lot of room, and he's got to move to more specificity\", \"CHENEY: The other thing he's got to do is deal with tort reform\", 'The American people fundamentally know that the cost of malpractice is -- is a huge cost savings here', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: You heard Senator Kerry -- but, you know, both Bill Bradley in the Times today, but also Senator Kerry, interestingly, seemed to make -- seemed to accept that that could be part of a final deal', \"Let's change subjects now and get to the other big news of the week, the attorney general's decision to investigate possible CIA abuses\", 'The president first spoke about this back in February', '(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)', \"PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen, but that, generally speaking, I'm more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards\", '(END VIDEO CLIP)', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: Now, the attorney general made this decision this week, and it wasn't necessarily a decision, I think, the White House was all that happy with, George Will\", 'But it does appear to meet those broad parameters the president laid out', 'According to -- the attorney general is not going to investigate those who wrote the law', \"He's not going to investigate the policymakers, only those who went outside the guidelines given to the CIA\", \"WILL: The president speaks as though he's a disinterested bystander, and the Obama administration's position seems to be, the president cannot control the attorney general -- which is false -- and even more dangerously false, that the attorney general can control this prosecutor\", \"If we've learned anything at all -- and we maybe haven't -- from all the prosecutors we've had in recent years, it is that they get their own momentum, they get their own agenda, they follow what they call the logic of the law, and\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: So what's the danger then\", 'WILL: The danger is that you not only start to prosecute people in a way that looks like double jeopardy in some cases, but you begin to go up the food chain toward the senior levels of the Bush administration', 'DONALDSON: George, as I understand it, a person that has been called a prosecutor has been appointed to determine whether in his opinion there is grounds to proceed with prosecutions', 'He will make a recommendation', 'There are no prosecutions', 'He is not prosecuting at the moment', 'WILL: And if he recommends yes, who is to say no', '(CROSSTALK)', 'DONALDSON: Well, as you say, it will be the president ultimately', '(CROSSTALK)', 'CHENEY: The investigation has already been done', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: One thing administration officials say', 'DONALDSON: By the Bush administration', 'CHENEY: No, by career', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: Excuse me, Sam', \"That's where the discussions could come in\", \"I'll go to you in a second, Liz\", \"That's the argument they're making, is that he just does this initial investigation, and that further on in the process, either the attorney general or the White House could then make the decision -- you know you're right, these were investigated before, it's not worth prosecuting again, even though there is some evidence\", \"CHENEY: Well, I'm not sure that there is some evidence\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: If there were', 'CHENEY: This was looked at for five years by career prosecutors', 'They decided not to prosecute, except in one case where a contractor has been convicted and is in jail', 'In the other cases, Leon Panetta himself has laid out to his employees that they took disciplinary action where they felt it was necessary at the CIA', \"The other big danger here, though, is we've investigated all of this before\", 'We are now opening what is clearly a political investigation at a moment when we need the CIA focused on keeping the nation safe', \"And there's no question but that when you start talking about investigating and prosecuting, people having to hire lawyers to defend against this, it is simply the case that their attention is not entirely focused where we need it to be\", \"And I think it's very damaging (ph)\", 'STEPHANOPOULOS: E', 'J', ', there does seem to be a dilemma here', \"On the one hand, the Justice Department lawyers say, listen, if there's some evidence of wrongdoing, we're bound by statutes to investigate\", 'On the other hand, you do have this double jeopardy problem, where people were investigated under the previous administration', 'Even if you find some (inaudible) evidence, there might be a reason not to go forward because it does appear to be politicizing this', \"DIONNE: You know, what's astonishing is that Eric Holder is being accused of politicizing this when he has made a decision that has clearly made the White House unhappy\", \"The White House would prefer this to go away, and I think what it does show is finally we do have an independent Justice Department that's making decisions on the basis of law\", \"I don't think he had a choice\", 'New information emerged publicly that had been there before, but there was new information', \"CHENEY: There's no new information\", \"It's just not true\", 'DIONNE: Emerged publicly -- people looked at it -- no, it was public for the first time', 'People looked at it', \"CHENEY; But that doesn't mean it's new\", 'DIONNE:', 'this raises serious questions', \"CHENEY: It's five years old\", 'DIONNE: The Justice Department can also have serious questions about what we now know is a very politicized Bush Justice Department and how it dealt with these cases', \"And so I think -- there is this issue of the food chain, and I think that's why ultimately you can't just prosecute a couple of people and end it there\", \"And so that's why I think you're going to end up with some kind of a truth commission, a study of this whole thing\", 'Because we have got to figure out how to deal with it', '(CROSSTALK) IFILL: Yes, I\\'m not convinced they\\'re going to open up the whole can of worms, but if you\\'re a Democratic president and you are a Democratically appointed attorney general, and you are holding your hand as CIA inspector general\\'s report which says -- I wrote this down -- \"the enhanced interrogation techniques used by the agency under the CTC program are inconsistent with the public policy positions that the U', 'S', 'has taken regarding human rights', '\"', \"Even if this has been investigated before, how do you as a Democratically appointed attorney general and a Democratic president not say let's take a look at this, even if it's a slippery slope as George says\", 'CHENEY: What you do is you say it has already been looked at', \"I mean, that's the piece of this\", 'DONALDSON: By whom', 'CHENEY: By career prosecutors', 'DONALDSON: In the Bush administration Justice Department', 'CHENEY: But, Sam, they were less political than Eric Holder, who is a political appointment', '(CROSSTALK)', \"CHENEY: But the other point here that's important to look at\", \"DONALDSON: Had that 2004 report been made public and then they look at it, the public looks at it and they say, all right, so drilling by the guy's ear, perhaps raping a female member of his family\", 'CHENEY: First of all, OK, that is totally -- that is just inexcusable', \"DONALDSON: It's in the report\", 'CHENEY: It is -- nobody raped anybody and nobody', '(CROSSTALK)', 'DONALDSON: No, (inaudible) they threatened it', 'CHENEY: There is a big difference', 'But let me -- the other point here to look at', \"DONALDSON: Oh, if I threaten you but don't actually hit you, there's a big difference, but you can call me to court\", '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: The law said that the threats were illegal', \"I mean, it's against the law\", 'CHENEY: No, wait a second', \"That's not clear\", \"And the standard -- we don't want to spend a whole panel here on the standard for the legal investigation\", 'DONALDSON: Why not', '(CROSSTALK)', \"CHENEY: You guys have misstated the standard for the legal investigation here, and I would point you to Andy McCarthy's excellent piece in National Review Online, which goes through what the standard is that the Justice Department should have applied here, which is the notion that you need evidence, that you can move beyond the presumption of innocence in a court of law, that torture occurred and that is not here, and that was, as I said, it was looked at before\", 'But the other point that is critical to me', 'DONALDSON: Everyone except one person that I know of (inaudible) says torture and waterboarding is wrong', \"CHENEY: The lack of -- waterboarding isn't torture\", 'And we can go down that path', 'But the lack of seriousness here is important', '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: I got to go to another question here', 'CHENEY: It also goes to the point about moving the interrogations out of the CIA into the White House', \"And I think that the fact that the White House can't even tell us who is in charge of these interrogations now combined\", \"STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, they say that there has to be broader sharing, that's what everybody wants, the FBI, the CIA\", '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: But I do want to get to the other question of the information we gleaned from all this, and whether it was -- it was worth the interrogations that were conducted', 'WILL: This is why my liberal friend here, the law of averages having caught up with him, has got something right', 'We ought to have a commission', \"Fred Hyatt in the Washington Post suggests this morning, Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter, bring them down, set it up, and answer some factual questions\", 'For example, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was reticent', 'He was waterboarded 183 times and became loquacious', 'Did it have something to do with that', 'And was he useful', 'Because whether or not these techniques are immoral or how immoral they are surely depends on whether or not they work', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: And how useful the information was, whether it could have been gotten in other ways, these are big questions', '(CROSSTALK)', \"DIONNE: Right, and because the CIA's own office of legal counsel raised questions in its report about how effective these methods are, and the worst thing would be to do something wrong and have it been ineffective\", 'DONALDSON: And (inaudible) say it saves lives, and that may be', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: If it saved lives', 'CHENEY: If', 'Hold on', 'If you read the documents that were released', '(CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: Sam, Liz, go ahead', 'DONALDSON: All right', \"I'm with Admiral Blair, who is our top intelligence guy\", 'Supposedly everyone comes under him', 'He said he thought we did receive some useful information from these techniques', \"He then said, the part that's left out by people who take the first part, but in our relationship with the rest of the world and the way the United States is viewed by the rest of the world, it was not worth it\", 'We have lost more by those techniques than we gained', 'I am with Admiral Blair', 'CHENEY: Well, I would suggest you read the documents in their entirety', 'DONALDSON: I read what he said', \"CHENEY: In their entirety, the documents that were released, because in those documents it makes absolutely clear not only in the inspector general's report, page 91, that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed provided information that was inaccurate and incomplete prior to being waterboarded, but also if you read the addendum to that document, which is an interview that was done with a senior CIA official, makes clear that that information could not have been gained through other ways, says that the techniques were invaluable and that they worked\", 'The documents -- let me finish', 'DIONNE: It does not prove that waterboarding produced that', \"It just doesn't\", 'CHENEY: Guys, guys, the documents demonstrate conclusively that the enhanced interrogation program provided information that saved lives', 'Four former CIA directors including', 'DONALDSON: Why did the Bush administration renounce waterboarding in its last two years', '(CROSSTALK)', \"STEPHANOPOULOS: We're going to have to continue this\", 'CHENEY: Dennis Blair said it worked', 'And the White House edited that part out of his statement', '(CROSSTALK)', 'STEPHANOPOULOS: We are out of time', 'I just say this one other -- the inspector general said -- the inspector general in the report, the inspector general said that finally it is a subjective interpretation, which is probably why the commission is needed', 'You guys continue this in the green room', 'END']\n",

is the - your vision for what a middle class economy looks', 'like', 'GILLIBRAND: So I think the most important thing that we have to do which,', 'you know, frankly the country hasn`t focused enough on is rewarding work', 'again', 'Actually rewarding people`s work and what that means to me is four', 'things', 'The first is, let workers organize, collective bargain and form unions', 'It`s so important when you have an –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: – a good (ph) representation because then you can – workers', 'can have a voice to make sure they have fair pay, good pay, and have good', 'benefits', 'It`s really important', 'We have to raise the minimum wage to a', 'living wage, $15, and get rid of the tipped wage and then index that to', 'inflation', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: So, many more (ph) reasons why', 'The second idea is that we', 'have to make sure a full employment is actually a national priority, and', 'what that means to me to is to make sure that we can train workers', 'Anyone', 'who is underemployed or unemployed will get access to job training that is', 'created in our community colleges, state schools, apprenticeship programs,', 'not-for-profits, with the employers directly so you have a pipeline to jobs', 'and fully fund that', 'The third thing I would do, which helps our moms and dads is, we have to', 'change the infrastructure of work and what that means to me is the National', 'Paid Leave Plan, we`re the only industrialized country in the world that', 'doesn`t have it', 'We need to actually understand that all workers need that, whether it`s a', 'parent who`s dying and sick, whether it`s a loved who`s ill, whether it`s a', 'new baby', 'Affordable daycare, universal pre-K and making sure it`s equal', 'pay for equal work, and then –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: – that the infrastructure of work (inaudible)', 'And last, we', 'need to reward good corporate behavior and punish behavior, so you need', 'carrots and sticks', 'Carrots are things like a bill that I just passed in the last Congress,', 'again with the Republican House, Senate, and president signed into law,', 'which was a made in America bill to help more manufacturers get access to', 'more government funding to help them grow manufacturing jobs, and then if a', 'company ships jobs overseas, I`m introducing a new bill this Congress, that', 'they will be punished, that we can actually take back any tax deductions or', 'tax benefits they had and take away any tax breaks, because they cannot be', 'rewarded', 'And if I am President of the United States, I promise you I will work on', 'rewarding work in all these ways, but I will also make sure no company', 'outsources our jobs without paying a penalty', '(APPLAUSE)', 'HAYES: Yes', 'So, I just wanted to follow-up, because A', 'J', 'sitting right', 'there works for UAW, and I have watched, in my career of following', 'politicians around, I have heard them talk about, we`re not going to let', 'corporations outsource jobs', 'Every politician I`ve ever seen, because it', 'gets applause', 'People don`t like outsourcing of jobs', 'And guess what`s', 'happened, lots of outsourcing', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'HAYES: Donald Trump was the best at running this particular con', '(APPLAUSE)', 'HAYES: I guess my question to you A', 'J', ', as someone who watched this', 'happen, right, in terms of your membership, like what concretely, tangibly,', 'what are you looking for when people talk about making sure that the jobs', 'stay here in a place like Michigan', 'A', 'J', 'FREER, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: It`s an honor, Senator', 'And we`ve seen in', 'the auto industry, over 30 years, the most dominant current example is', 'General Motors shipping five plants overseas', 'They received $50 billion in', 'a bail-out, you`ve been good in your voting record on supporting', 'autoworkers', 'I`ve checked it out', 'They received a five – over $500', 'million tax credit from Trump and his corporate tax cut', 'Now, our workers that have been in auto factories work harder than anybody', 'else in the world, and we know that these jobs are being sent away to', 'exploit workers', 'They have no health and safety regulations in China and', 'Mexico', 'They have no rights to real unions, they have rights to fake', 'unions, run by companies', 'As the President of the United States, the 50, 60-year-old auto worker', 'who`s seen his job leave is tired of hearing, you`re going to have to learn', 'a new skill set', 'They don`t want to hear you need to learn to code', 'They', 'don`t want burial insurance', 'They want their jobs', 'They want the right to', 'work in dignified, good-paying jobs, and they`re also concerned about those', 'good-paying jobs being here for their children and grandchildren', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'UNIDENTFIED MALE: So we`re looking in the auto workforce for a real', 'solution to these problems that have developed over 30 years', 'GILLIBRAND: OK, so I think there`s a couple of things we need to do', 'As I', 'said, making sure our unions are strong, fighting against right to work', 'states is going to be priority, because it`s just pushing down wages and', 'making sure people don`t have collective bargaining rights, which we think', 'is an outrage', 'In terms of the auto industry particularly, I think there`s ways we can', 'incentivize keeping jobs here through the Green New Deal', 'One of the', 'things that that bill`s about, which we`ll talk about later I think, is', 'about energy efficiency', 'So when you have a manufacturer who`s making', 'cars, there`s a whole industry ahead of us about energy efficient cars,', 'about battery propelled cars, about less carbon emission cars', 'We are the greatest investors in the world', 'People who work in your', 'industry have been investing and building cars for decades, for', 'generations', 'So why not unleash the innovation, the entrepreneurialism of', 'your industry to actually create the cars of tomorrow, and if you create a', 'tax incentive so that it`s so much cheaper to do that car manufacturing', 'here in America, because you are solving the problem, that is a win-win for', 'everyone', 'And so, I - the reason why I believe the Green New Deal is such a market', 'opportunity is because it`s a strategy to keep jobs here, to create', 'innovation, and I also believe we should put a price on carbon', 'And the', 'reason why this is so relevant to you – so when you have manufacturers', 'that send jobs overseas, they`re producing typical, traditional cars that', 'are polluting the environment', 'Why not reward the innovators in the United', 'States with much lower taxes and tax requirements to incentivize capital', 'flows to keep those jobs here', 'FREER: Can I follow up on that', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, please', 'FREER: I think you make outstanding points, and I love your vision', 'The', 'thing I`m interested also to know is, you talked about making it', 'incentivized for the companies to stay here', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, yes', 'FREER: We`re looking for real solutions to make corporations want to stay', 'here, so that`s going to include more regulation', 'It`s going to include', 'more laws', 'Is there specifically things that when you win presidency -', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'FREER: - that you want to enact right away', 'GILLIBRAND: Well, the tax benefits to make it cheaper to put a', 'manufacturing plant in Michigan today to manufacturing cars', 'That – money', 'flows when tax rates are lower', 'That`s just how the economy works', 'The', 'other thing I would do is take on China in a very different way than Trump', 'does', 'So Trump has started a trade war', 'When you start a trade war,', 'you`re not holding China accountable', 'In fact, you`re just raising prices', 'Steel, a fundamental input for manufacturing, because we have a trade war', 'with China on steel, it`s raising the cost of you producing that steel in', 'American because of his trade war', 'HAYES: Let me - I want to ask - stop for one second', 'Do people - how does', 'it feel - positive or negative about the tariffs', 'Negative', 'Put your hand', 'in the air if you`re negative on the tariff', 'GILLIBRAND: Negative', 'The trade wars are a disaster, but you have to hold', 'China accountable, because what they did before is they would dump steel on', 'the markets and -', 'HAYES: Right', 'GILLIBRAND: - and totally undermine our manufacturing and our', 'competitiveness, and we didn`t hold them accountable enough', 'So there`s a', 'difference between holding a country accountable and starting a trade war', 'HAYES: Let me turn to Rebecca -', 'GILLIBRAND: Should I follow up', 'HAYES: I want to turn to Rebecca just for -', 'GILLIBRAND: OK, we`ll talk more', 'HAYES: - time purposes and talking about for the - the situation you`re', 'in', 'REBECCA PLESSNER, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: Yes', 'HAYES: Situation near and dear to my heart, as I have a 1-year-old at home', 'and three kids', 'What would you like to hear from the Senator', 'PLESSNER: Sure', 'So I had a baby last year', 'He`s actually 11 months old', 'today, and I`m fortunate enough to work for a company that has a very', 'generous paid leave program, which was fantastic, but being off made me', 'realize -', 'GILLIBRAND: What`s your child`s name', 'PLESSNER: His name is Theodore', 'GILLIBRAND: Do you call him Theo', 'PLESSNER: I call him Theo', 'GILLIBRAND: Oh my, did you set this up', 'HAYES: I did not, but I -', 'GILLIBRAND: That is my oldest son`s name', 'HAYES: I know -', '(CROSSTALK)', 'GILLIBRAND: And did you know Theodore means gift of God', 'PLESSNER: I did not know that', 'GILLIBRAND: Did you know that', 'PLESSNER: He`s certainly a gift from god', 'GILLIBRAND: That is the best thing about that name', 'PLESSNER: Oh my gosh (ph), I love that', 'Well very cool', 'GILLIBRAND: So tell me more about Theo (ph)', 'PLESSNER: Yes absolutely', 'So I just realized when I was off like how', 'difficult it is to be a new mom, how crazy I felt all the time', 'And like I', 'said, I had the time off, but I just don`t understand how women do it', 'without that flexibility', 'So I know you talk about -', 'GILLIBRAND: How did you have the time off', 'PLESSNER: Yes, so my company provides four months of paid family leave', 'GILLIBRAND: Paid leave', 'Oh my goodness, so you`re one of the lucky ones', 'Yes, she is a lucky one', 'HAYES: Can I just say there is just a - there was a room wide gasp over -', 'over what is the bare minimum of OECD paid family leave in the rest of the', 'industrialized world', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, you realize - you realize less than 16 percent of', 'American workers have access to paid leave', 'And we are the only', 'industrialized country in the world that doesn`t actually have paid leave', 'as a national priority', 'So what`s your question', 'PLESSNER: So my question is how are you planning to enact that, like what', 'are your visions for that, what are -', 'GILLIBRAND: Well the vision -', 'PLESSNER: – how are you going to get people to sign onto that', 'It seems', 'like a very obvious thing to me', 'HAYES: That`s a good question', 'GILLIBRAND: OK, I`ll tell you how', 'So first of all, the American people', 'want national paid leave', 'Let`s start there', 'We even have a president who', 'I agree with on basically nothing talking about the need for paid leave', 'HAYES: It`s true', 'GILLIBRAND: We have Republican candidates talk about paid leave and many', 'Democratic candidates', 'So the country is in agreement, we need national paid leave', 'The best way', 'to provide national paid leave is to make it an earned benefit, so that you', 'buy in over your lifetime whether you`re working full time, part time, big', 'business, small business, so that it`s yours', 'It`s the way for a small state, like when I was talking about this idea', 'years ago, a place like North Dakota, they vetoed paid leave because the', 'state wasn`t big enough to pass it on their own', 'New York and California', 'have already passed paid leave', 'But not smaller states, because they don`t', 'have enough people', 'And so if you bought in', '2 percent of your income,', 'it`s basically two dollars a week, would you pay two dollars a week to get', 'access to paid leave', 'PLESSNER: Sure', 'GILLIBRAND: Of course you would', 'PLESSNER: Of course I would', '(CROSSTALK)', 'HAYES: So this works like social insurance, like -', 'GILLIBRAND: It`s like social security, it`s the cost of a cup of coffee a', 'week, and if I go to every employer in America and say would you buy every', 'employee of yours one cup of coffee a week so that he or she can have paid', 'leave when their family member needed it, overwhelmingly small businesses', 'that can`t offer it, they don`t have the ability, don`t have the resources', 'to offer it will say “Yes I can offer that', '”', 'And there`s no overhead because it`s just like social security', 'PLESSNER: So, sorry can I - can I clear up something', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, yes', 'PLESSNER: OK, so both me and my employer would be paying into this fund', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes, two dollars a week', 'So it`s not a lot of money -', 'HAYES: So like unemployment, insurance, disability, social security', 'GILLIBRAND: It`s $104 a year for employees, you pay, they pay, that`s not', 'a great deal of money and one that if you create this fund, Chris, when', 'your employer says “Oh gosh, she`s going to be out for three months, I`m', 'going to have to hire a quick replacement worker or a temp,” they can use', 'your old salary to begin to fund that temp, because now you`re going to get', 'the payment straight out of your fund that you bought in', 'So it`s yours', 'You get to take it with you everywhere you go', 'HAYES: Sonia, you`ve got a - you`ve got a daughter who`s in college now,', 'is that right', 'SONIA PATEL, MICHIGAN RESIDENT: No, she`s in high school, I have a son in', 'college', 'HAYES: Son in college, and you`re sort of thinking about what their career', 'or job opportunity is going to look like, what would you like to hear', 'PATEL: Right, well I had so many fears for them that I didn`t have before,', 'I mean there`s -they`re children of immigrants, now I worry about my', 'daughter, I worry about, you know, if she`s ever assaulted no one`s going', 'to believe her', 'I worry about the opportunities presented for her, I worry that she`s going', 'to out work anyone, but I don`t know if she`s going to be paid for that', 'work', 'I just - I feel as a mom in this day and age, everything is', 'different', 'GILLIBRAND: So many issues', 'OK, so we`ll talk about education first, and', 'one of the problems with President Trump is Betsy DeVos', 'I voted against Betsy DeVos, I voted against most of President Trump`s', 'nominees for his cabinet because they were either unqualified or they did', 'not have the experience necessary', 'I have the best voting record against', 'Trump nominees of anyone else running for president', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: And the reason why I`m so disturbed about Betsy Devos`s exact', 'words, she said she doesn`t actually want to enforce Title IX requirements,', 'she doesn`t want to protect survivors of sexual violence on a college', 'campus', 'I`ve been working on a bipartisan basis – and remember,', 'bipartisan basis about how you get things done with – with an array of', 'senators from all different backgrounds including Marco Rubio on this issue', '–', 'PATEL: Wow', 'GILLIBRAND: – on this issue of how do we end – how do we end sexual', 'violence and assault on a college campus', 'We need transparency and', 'accountability, we have to have a nationwide survey so every kid in America', 'can fill out a form saying do you feel safe, have you been assaulted, if', 'you have did you report, if not, why not', 'That would create transparency', 'and accountability overnight', 'We need memorandums of understanding to work with law enforcement so if', 'someone is a survivor and wants to go to law enforcement, they won`t` be', 'laughed out of the police station, which happens all the time', 'And you', 'need to make sure that you hold them accountable, and to make sure anyone', 'who deals in these cases is fully trained, so that`s issue one', 'You also were worried about affordability', 'Student debt is one of the', 'biggest crises we have in this country today', 'I believe that the federal', 'should not be making money off the backs of our students and that`s exactly', 'what`s happening –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: So one of the quickest ways to get rid of student debt is', 'refinance all federal student debt at the lowest rate for debt that`s', 'available', 'So your house mortgage, your business loan –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: – today that`s about four percent', 'If you refinance all', 'federal debt at four percent automatically you would be $15 billion right', 'back into the economy', 'HAYES: Wow', 'GILLIBRAND: I also think that we should –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: – make college more affordable to more kids', 'Imagine telling', 'every American kid if you do public service for a year, you get two years', 'free of community college (inaudible) –', '(APPLAUSE)', 'GILLIBRAND: Imagine if you told them – imagine if you told them if you –', 'if you do two years of public service, you get four years free', 'PATEL: Wow', 'GILLIBRAND: That would create a pipeline of kids doing service for someone', 'else', 'And I promise you, when you spend any time putting others before', 'yourself – any time, whether you`re in healthcare or education or as a', 'first responder or as someone in the military – it`s an expansion of the', 'G', 'I', 'bill', 'And it works', 'The G', 'I', 'bill is one of the greatest economic', 'engines in our history', 'So that`s my big idea for how more kids can get to', 'education that`s much more affordable, because it`s free (ph)', 'PATEL: I like it', '(APPLAUSE)', 'HAYES: We`ve got some more questions from folks here', 'I want to thank', 'Eddie and Rebecca, A', 'J', 'and Sonia', 'Thank you so much', 'We`ll be back with', 'some more

person, and that really changed', 'in 2007, 2008 with the candidacy of Barack Obama, and I was very inspired', 'by him', 'But then I stopped paying attention and I got complacent', 'UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When it comes to healthcare, what are you hearing from', 'voters', 'BROOKS: Obviously I`m a physician, so I`m in the industry', 'And so, it is', 'something that I see everyday, day-in and day-out',

the Senator', 'BROOKS: Yes, so I am a physician, and as a physician and a healthcare', 'provider, we are on the frontlines', 'So I`ve seen many concerning things on', 'healthcare recently especially', 'I have a patient who he works, he has a', 'job, but he cannot afford the premiums that are rising, he cannot afford', 'the $900 a month premiums', 'He also makes too much money to qualify for the', 'ACA and Medicaid, and he`s too young to qualify for Medicare', 'So he is', 'literally praying every day that he doesn`t develop some catastrophic', 'illness until he`s able to qualify for Medicare', 'I have a patient just', 'last week who told me he couldn`t afford his insulin, and he was asking me', 'what could he do', 'And insulin, you can`t live without insulin if you`re an insulin-dependent', 'diabetic', 'It`s a life saving medication', 'And I have a lot of patients', 'that are of mature population and they live on a fixed income and they', 'cannot afford these rising premiums and co-pays and healthcare costs that', 'are happening', 'So, you know, I know that you support Medicare for All', 'How would that work', 'How you would implement it, how would you get it', 'done', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'So I believe, as I think most Americans do, that', 'healthcare should be a right and not a privilege', 'And that means you have', 'to fight for universal coverage that`s affordable and quality for', 'everybody', 'I think the quickest way you get there is you allow anyone to', 'buy into Medicare at a price they can afford – something like four or five', 'percent of income', 'They buy in, so it`s an earned benefit and they are', 'qualified automatically for Medicare', 'What that does at a minimum is', 'create competition in the system immediately', 'Those insurers, I don`t', 'think they are going to compete', 'They refuse to lower their rates; they`re', 'pricing people out of the market today', 'But for the Affordable Care Act they were dropping people with preexisting', 'conditions

a couple years we`re', 'going to transition into single payer', 'HAYES: So I just want to be clear on that', 'GILLIBRAND: Yes', 'HAYES: So you`re not saying start with single payer', 'What you`re saying', 'is introduce potentially a buy-in option –', 'GILLIBRAND: Correct', 'HAYES: – and it`s possible that private insurance continues to exist', 'under that –', '(CROSSTALK)', 'GILLIBRAND: I dare them', 'HAYES: That`s OK with you (ph)', 'GILLIBRAND: I dare them, because I don`t think they will meet the needs', 'because they`re a for-profit company', 'When your goal is to make money for', 'your shareholders, you are not giving that patient the medicine they need', 'or the treatment they need or the extra day in the hospital they need', 'because it doesn`t allow you to make enough money', 'So I don`t think they will compete', 'So create this not-for-profit public', 'option as they transition', 'I imagine within a few years most of Americans', 'are going to choose Medicare, because it`s quality, it`s more affordable I', 'mean in your own mind, just think four or five percent of income on what', 'you make today', 'Is that cheaper or not', 'It`s going to be cheaper', 'If you', 'make $100,000, it`s $4,000 a year', 'It is cheaper', 'And almost – most Americans earn less than that, so that would be what I', 'would do because Medicare works', 'HAYES: Rick, you had a question for the

leaders gathered in the French capital in November 2015 to reach an agreement on fighting climate change, Nicaragua's lead envoy explained to reporters that the country would not support the agreed-upon plan as it hinged on voluntary pledges and would not punish those who failed to meet them\", 'That was simply not enough, Paul Oquist argued', '“We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,” Oquist told the website Climate Home on Nov', '30', '“We don’t want to be an accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents', '”', '[Graphic: All but two countries are in the Paris climate agreement', 'The U', 'S', 'could be the third', ']', 'Oquist, who was in Paris representing Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, said rich countries should pay more for climate change, as they were historically responsible for causing more damage to the environment and developing nations such as his own would be the worst hit', \"Syria, on the other hand, was effectively an international pariah when the Paris accord was first signed, making Damascus's involvement at the least impractical\", '(Members of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government remain subject to both European and American sanctions, making it nearly impossible for them to travel unless to friendly countries such as Russia and Iran', ')', 'The Paris meetings also stretched through some of the heaviest fighting of Syria’s seven years of civil conflict', 'The war has torn the nation apart, with accusations of human rights violations arising from both sides and casualties mounting into the thousands', \"Given the nature of the conflict during Paris negotiations, the Assad government was in no position to commit to limiting Syria's climate emissions\", 'That Syria was not involved in the Paris agreement was hardly a surprise, though it should be noted that other isolated countries (North Korea) or those in a state of conflict (Iraq, Yemen) were able to sign the agreement', \"There was, however, criticism of Nicaragua's hard-line stance at the time, with some worried that its arguments could sway other developing nations\", '[Trump nearing a decision on whether to pull U', 'S', 'from Paris climate deal, breaking ranks with more than 190 countries]', 'According to the Guardian, then-Secretary of State John F', 'Kerry and Cuban President Raúl Castro called Ortega in December 2015 urging that Oquist not deliver a speech denouncing the deal until after the agreement was adopted', 'That Oquist did hold off may have signaled that Nicaragua did not intend to scuttle the agreement, even if it disagreed with it', 'Ultimately, representatives of almost all countries signed the agreement on April 22, 2016', 'Uzbekistan, the last country to sign the agreement, did so a year later', '(A large number of nations still need to ratify it', 'The Obama administration, however, avoided declaring the Paris accord a treaty, to avoid the battle over ratification in the Senate that hobbled the Kyoto Protocol', ')', 'Nicaragua is particularly vulnerable to climate change', 'According to the 2017 Global Climate Risk Index, Nicaragua is the fourth-most at-risk nation in the world due to changing climates — behind only Honduras, Burma and Haiti', 'Syria is not included in the index because of the problem of collecting data during the conflict there', 'However, droughts potentially caused by climate change are commonly cited as a contributing factor that led to war in the country, although there is significant debate about this theory', 'Nicaragua pushed back against the Paris accord because it thought the deal was too weak', 'Syria was not involved in the negotiations as the country was at war', 'The United States may soon join these two nations in standing outside the Paris agreement, but its reasons will be very different', 'President Trump has decided to pull the U', 'S', 'out of the

leading experts on national security\", 'Joe Lieberman is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee', 'And General Michael Hayden is former director of the CIA', 'Gentlemen, welcome back', 'SEN', 'JOE LIEBERMAN, I-CONN', ': Thank you', 'WALLACE: As you look at these extraordinary series of leaks, everything from the double agent inside al Qaeda in Yemen, to the details about the U', 'S', 'and Israeli joint cyber campaign against Iraq', 'Let me start with you, Senator Lieberman', 'How much damage has been done to our national security', 'LIEBERMAN: In my opinion, an enormous amount has been done to our national security', 'I mean, in the case of the cyber attack in Iraq, if the articles are true, this is the first confirmation of that', 'Some methods of how it was carried were telegraphed to the Iran', \"I think there's a danger that it may legitimize an Iranian or a terrorist counter cyber attack on us because we did it\", 'In the case of the underwear bomb from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- again, these leaks jeopardized that operation', 'Potentially put the individual who courageously infiltrated AQ in the Arabian Peninsula in danger and his family', 'This will discourage people and foreign intelligence services from cooperating with us in the future', \"Finally in the case of the Osama bin Laden kill, the fact that we leaked the story that a doctor was retained to carry out a vaccination program and trying to get DNA from people in bin Laden's compound led the Pakistanis to the doctor and he's now been convicted and sentenced to 333 years in jail\", 'Who is going to cooperate with us next time as a result of that', 'So, yes, these leaks compromise the security of every American', 'WALLACE: General Hayden, I want to pick up on what Senator Lieberman said', \"Are some of these leaks giving away what's known as sources and methods, the Holy Grail of intelligence, and especially in the case of alleged U\", 'S', '-Israeli cyber attack against Iran -- does it invite retaliation by the mullahs in Tehran', 'GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CIA: I think so', \"And to reiterate the point the senator made, these don't have to be true to be harmful\", 'So, you take the Stuxnet story', \"It's almost like --\", \"WALLACE: That's a computer virus that allegedly were used against the Iranians\", 'HAYDEN: Right', \"That's taunting the Iranians\", 'Imagine this -- my counterpart when I was director of CIA was (INAUDIBLE)', 'I can just picture him now going to the supreme leader Khamenei and saying, you know those things we discussed a year or two ago, Mr', 'Supreme Leader, and you told me to put them on the back burner', \"I think it's now time to resurrect those ideas\", 'I mean, it sort of legitimates an Iranian response, whether the story is true or false', 'WALLACE: General, in the cyber warfare story that appeared on the front page of \"The New York Times,\" you are quoted saying this, and let\\'s put it on the screen', '\"This is the first attack of a major nature in which a cyber attack was used to affect physical obstruction', 'Somebody crossed the Rubicon', '\"', \"Didn't you at least indirectly confirm the leak\", 'HAYDEN: No', 'In fact, I was quite clear', 'Totally agnostic as to who did this, but it is accepted knowledge and public knowledge that this happened', 'Whoever did it crossed a policy barrier, made a decision that in a time of peace, one could use cyber weapon to inflict physical destruction on what another nation could only describe as their own critical infrastructure', \"WALLACE: But in you're in no way confirm --\", 'HAYDEN: No', 'WALLACE: -- that the U', 'S', 'was involved', 'HAYDEN: No, not at all', 'WALLACE: OK', \"As we discussed with David Plouffe, some of the people quoted in this article, not saying that they were the ones who gave up these specific secrets, but the national security advisor, Tom Donilon, the former White House chief-of-staff Bill Daley quoted specifically giving up some of this -- members of the president's national security team who were with him in meetings in the Situation Room\", 'Question for you, Senator Lieberman -- do you have thoughts about who was leaking these stories and why', \"LIEBERMAN: I don't have any thoughts about who is leaking the stories\", \"But we have to try to find out and that's what the investigation and the Justice Department ought to do\", \"There's nothing new here about leaks in Washington\", \"This happened during the Clinton and Bush administration and earlier Obama administration and Bob Woodward's books for instance\", 'But the recent series of leaks are the worst in the long time', \"I think run a slippery slope where people think there is no accountability if you leak and we've got to change that\", \"I think we've got to change the law that's applied here\", 'The last person to be convicted of a crime for leaking to the media was more than 25 years ago', 'We are using a 1917 Espionage Act that requires some showing of intent and knowledge that a leak would harm the security of the United States', 'But, Chris, if you -- it seems to me that the law ought to say simply: if you disclose without authority classified information, you committed a crime, because for information to be classified, there was a judgment made that its disclosure would cause damage in the case of top secret information, which a lot of these was, it would cause exceptionally grave damage to the security of the United States', 'So, this is something that has to be found', 'One last point: David Sanger says in the --', \"WALLACE: He was the fellow who wrote about the cyber warfare and he's written a book on this\", 'LIEBERMAN: Right', 'He says that his writing is based on conversations with high ranking officials in the U', 'S', \"government and other governments who don't want to be identified, because the information they shared is highly classified and relates to some ongoing operation\", \"That's an acknowledgment of a crime in my opinion and that's why the Justice Department ought to get to the bottom of this\", 'WALLACE: Let me follow on this with you, General Hayden, because you have been in these meetings', \"You've been in the Situation Room\", 'How closely held is this kind of information', 'You know, we are talking about sources and methods', 'We are talking about agents that we had in those countries', 'We are talking about a major campaign against Iran', 'How closely held is the information and do people just leave the room and go out on their own and leak this kind much information', \"HAYDEN: Well, they shouldn't certainly\", 'And this is very closely held information', 'Again, without commenting on whether the story is true or false', 'If you follow the storyline that David Sanger lays out, this would have been a covert action', 'Covert action requires the personal involvement of the president, his personal approval', 'And there are a few things in the American government that are as closely protected as covert actions are', 'I mean, after all, the word covert has some meaning', \"Or at least it's supposed to\", 'WALLACE: Do you think this was political', \"Do you this is an effort to shine the president's record foreign policy\", \"HAYDEN: On the Stuxnet leak and the Sanger article, first of all, I'm reluctant to pass judgment\", \"But I'll believe what David Sanger said\", \"This wasn't in any way a press from anyone, so to speak\", 'He picked this up in bits and pieces through very good reporting', \"But that, however, doesn't indicate that some of that reporting didn't come from sources who were privy to this information\", 'WALLACE: Senator Lieberman, let me ask you some of the questions that I asked David Plouffe', 'Do you think that the president should, as George W', 'Bush did, order his entire staff, anyone who knows about those leaks, come forward', 'LIEBERMAN: I do', 'I mean, the president made very clear in the statement that you played earlier that he was outraged and anybody would think that anybody in his White House who was leaking classified information', 'I think the next step is ask all of them to come forward in just the way you said', 'WALLACE: You think he should agree, as President Bush did, to sit down with federal prosecutors for interrogation', \"LIEBERMAN: Well, that's up to him\", 'But, look, we are in a situation where I think the administration ought to do everything it can to eliminate any appearance that people in the administration leaked this highly classified information for political or other personal purposes', \"And I leave it to the president's attorneys\", \"But If I were advising him, I'd say he should sit down and talk to the investigators\", 'WALLACE: Finally, back in 2003, you said that we needed a special prosecutor and independent counsel in the Valerie Plame case', 'Given the extent of these leaks and the fact that top administration officials, not by name but are quoted as having been the sources, does there need to be a special prosecutor', \"LIEBERMAN: Chris, I've been thinking about this since these leaks came out\", 'And I reached a conclusion, which is that we do need a special counsel and we need a special counsel because special counsel avoids any appearance of conflict of interest', 'Special counsels, independent counsels, were created for a situation like this, where people might reach a conclusion that investigators, U', 'S', 'attorneys even, working for the attorney general, who was appointed by the president, cannot independently and without bias investigate high officials of their own government', 'WALLACE: So you are saying the U', 'S', 'attorneys that have been appointed by General Holder, Attorney General Holder, not enough special prosecutor', 'LIEBERMAN: Yeah, not enough', 'And I have no reason to distrust or disrespect either of these U', 'S', 'attorneys', 'But here we got one gentleman who gave a contribution to President Obama', 'No matter what he concludes, people are going to say it was biased', \"Here's the big difference between a regular U\", 'S', 'attorney and a special counsel, the special counsel is not under the day-to-day supervision of the Attorney General, he is really much more independent', \"And I think that's what -- frankly I think Attorney General Holder would do the administration and himself a favor if he appointed special councils in this case because it would remove any appearance that anybody in the administration was trying to block a full scale investigation and protect anybody in the administration who may have leaked\", \"WALLACE: We're going to have to leave it there\", 'Senator Lieberman, General Hayden, thank you both so much for coming in today to discuss these matters of vital national security', 'Thank you, gentlemen', 'Up next, the president goes around congress to make a major

'To qualify, they must been in the U', 'S', 'at least five years, no criminal history, have gone to high school or served in the military, and they can get renewable two year work permits', 'Bill, what do you think of the policy', 'And what do you think of the fact that the president went around congress and did this by executive action', \"BILL KRISTOL, WEEKLY STANDARD: I think it's a sensible policy\", 'I think it would be much better if that were the law of the land', \"And I think the president is pushing the edges of the limits of prosecutorial discretion and say we're not going to enforce a law in order to leave these people in the country, but I think it's the right thing to do actually\", 'WALLACE: OK', \"We're going to talk politics in a minute, but Joe what do you think of the policy\", 'JOE TRIPPI, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I think the policy is the right one', \"It's about -- I mean, I think he articulated it the right way, this is about what -- who we are going after\", 'They deported 400,000 people last year', \"So you're looking at, let's go after criminals, people who are violent in the community, people who are a threat to the American community, and not put so much focus, any focus on students, people seeking an education who are hear because their parents brought them here and who see themselves as Americans\", \"So I think that's what makes this a sensible policy until we can get a permanent one in place\", 'WALLACE: Karl, in the Bush White House you pushed comprehensive immigration reform', \"Given that there's a deadlock, a continuing deadlock over that, is this a good first step\", 'KARL ROVE, AMERICAN CROSSROADS FOUNDER: Well, first of all, I appreciate President Obama continuing the Bush policy era policies of prioritizing investigations and removals of criminals, criminal aliens', 'But look, we examined these questions significantly during the Bush years and concluded we had no statutory authority to offer in essence a blanket exemption from deportation without a change in the law', 'And this is what troubles me', \"This makes -- if the president felt so keenly about this, he's had three years to get something done on it\", \"And I don't think he has statutory authority to do this in a blanket way\", 'WALLACE: Even under the guise of', 'ROVE: Prioritization, yes', 'WALLACE: Of prosecutorial discretion', 'ROVE: Well, but remember discretion was meant to be on an individual basis, that is the key', 'There is no ability in the law to basically say we are going to create whole groups of people, not individuals, but groups of people -- in this case, people between the ages of 16 and 13 as being exempt from the provisions of the law', \"And so I think he's on very shaky grounds\", 'I wish he had gone to the congress', 'He would have had -- my suspicion is a very strong positive vote by congress on this, mostly Democrats but some Republicans', 'WALLACE: But wait a minute, he tried the DREAM Act', 'ROVE: No, no, no', 'The DREAM Act is not this', 'The DREAM Act is significantly different than this', 'This is a relatively narrow -- as Bill said, a relatively narrow and compassionate policy', 'And look, we can argue all day long about the individual merits of it', \"I mean, for example, somebody who comes here at age 16 is a -- in many countries from which they might come is considered an adult who has got a thought about I'm coming to -- it's not the three-year-old dragged here by their parents with no knowledge of coming here, it is a virtual adult maybe coming here to go to work or find a job\", 'So -- but this is better dealt with inside a congressional environment with the congress with the president working together', 'And I believe he is going to have problems sustaining this, because there is no statutory authority to grant an exemption for a whole group', 'WALLACE: Juan', 'JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: I mean, you know, I remember when Karl Rove and George W', \"Bush tried to get immigration policies, immigration reform passed through this congress and couldn't do it\", \"And why couldn't they do it\", 'Because of a group of Republicans and talk show hosts made it impossible', 'But I think that Republicans, you know, President Bush understood the importance of immigration reform to this country', 'President Obama went before the congress and tried to get it passed and he got 55 votes in the senate, Chris, 55 votes', 'But Republican filibuster stopped it', \"So what we have seen is all the complaints about we need immigration reform from the likes of Jan Brewer, it's being stopped at the national level by a small group of Republicans who have distorted the marketplace on this idea\", 'And the step the president took in terms of this executive action is something I think he should have taken a long time ago', \"WALLACE: All right, let's turn to the politics, because Hispanics, Joe, are a big voting block especially in key swing states like Florida, like Colorado, like Nevada\", 'You can see the percentage of the voters that are Hispanic in those states', 'They were upset with President Obama because he had not enacted as much of their agenda as they had wanted', 'Does this action win him the support, the enthusiastic support, of Hispanic voters in November', 'TRIPPI: I think he already has a big lead there but this helps solidify it', 'But even more, it helps -- I think this is a big step for the administration and for the campaign in the sense that it makes -- it articulates moving forward', 'This is a policy where the president, again, is trying to move the country forward, move immigration reform forward', 'And at this -- on this issue, Romney is behind George Bush', 'Bush was more of a reformer than Romney is on this issue', 'So it really starts to articulate the what the Obama campaign strategy of what moving forward, not just on this but on the economy and on other issues, versus Romney who wants to take the country in the past', \"That's the argument they're making I think this helps them do that\", 'WALLACE: All right', 'I want to pick up on that with you, Karl', 'Romney, as David Plouffe pointed out, he opposed the DREAM Act, said he would veto it', 'He called for self-deportation by the 11 million people here', 'He hammered Rick Perry about giving in-state tuition to illegals who want to go

eliminated and replaced by the extension of I-580 into Richmond and SR-17 was converted to I-880', 'The text is as follows:', 'This is to inform you that your application for the elimination of Route 180 and extension of Route 580, and the establishment of Route 880 and Route 238 have been approved', 'However, since the I-238 designation does not fit the overall national numbering sequence and was necessitated only because all three combinations of I-80 have been used, the Committee has a further option to offer for your consideration', 'If the I-580 designation were continued from Castro Valley to San Lorenzo and then used in place of the proposed I-880 designation northerly to Oakland and over existing I-180 between Albany and San Rafael, then existing I-580 between Castro Valley and Oakland could be designated I-180', 'The Committee does recognize this option would involve considerable resigning, however', \"Caltrans' Division of Highways and Programming Chief Donald Watson

therefore unable to recommend the designation of existing I-580 between Castro Valley and Oakland as I-180', 'On a related note, some years ago there was a proposal put forth to build a bay crossing that would have linked I-238 with I-380 near San Francisco Airport', 'That would have easily eliminated the I-238 mess', \"I don't know what became of that plan\", 'The above correspondence should prove that I-238 is not a flagrant violation that was allowed to occur just for the fun of it', 'While AASHTO did have the legitimate suggestion of using I-180 instead, the reply points out that 180 was an already established number', 'It also shows that AASHTO conceded that resigning the route as I-580 would be expensive, at least in the sense that considerable resigning would be required', 'Of course, the most important piece of information is that AASHTO did approve it', 'The story of the number 480 is quite a bit different, however', 'When I-238 was conceived, 480 had already been assigned to that god-awful monstrosity, the Embarcadero Freeway, known otherwise as the \"World\\'s Longest Off-ramp', '\" In my opinion, if 480 had come to its full fruition before San Francisco blocked it, it would have been such a complete disaster', \"It was supposed to skirt the waterfront between the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, which I think would have seriously tarnished San Francisco's charm\", 'Anyway, SR-480 started its life as I-480, being designated as such between its completion in 1957 and August, 1965', 'Apparently someone realized what a travesty this freeway was and that it did not even deserve to be called an Interstate, resulting in its redesignation as SR-480', 'As is well known, the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake condemned this freeway, much to the joy of just about everyone except for Caltrans', 'Route 480 (its ghost and all) was finally put to rest in 1991 and deleted from the state highway system, certainly with tears of sorrow from the eyes of Caltrans engineers falling on the order', 'While 480 is available now, it certainly was not back in 1988, which left I-238 as a remotely reasonable alternative', \"I-480 could rise from its ashes and replace I-238, but that will almost certainly not happen, and I'll explain why shortly\", 'So What Could or Should be Done', \"I've heard a lot of proposals for the future disposition of I-238\", 'Renumber it, say to I-480', 'Have it revert to being signed as a state highway', 'Renumber I-580 to I-705', 'Keep I-238 and build an I-338 to help alleviate traffic on I-680', 'And so on', 'I happen to think there is a lot of merit to these suggestions (although I-338 may be a little extreme as of yet), but I think the wisest course of action would be to leave it alone', 'Like it or not, I-238 is a legitimate Interstate; it was approved by AASHTO', 'Bear in mind that AASHTO is the organization that is responsible for maintaining and assigning the numbers for Interstate (as well as US) highways', \"This is significant since I-99, Bud Schuster's loathsome, detestable and vile pork barrel highway that it is, was designated by law, by brute force\", 'As I understand it, that means it never had to be legitimized by AASHTO', 'So if Mr', \"Schuster wanted, he could have had his little project designated as Interstate 1 (which I'm surprised he didn't since he obviously thinks he is #1) or even as I-38 without having to be accountable to anyone but himself\", 'So say what you might about I-238, but remember that Caltrans did not play God and had to have AASHTO approve it', \"I'm sure AASHTO did not approve it just for the heck of it\", 'There are some compelling arguments to be made for renumbering I-238', 'The I-480 designation has now been freed up and could be applied to that section of highway', 'It is a perfect candidate for an even numbered \"3di\" as it forms a (small) loop', 'It starts at I-880 and ends at I-580; a even numbered 3di in theory starts and ends at an Interstate, whether it is a parent or daughter route', 'It would also make it somewhat noteworthy as it would be one of the few 3dis that does not touch its parent Interstate, much like I-380', 'However, I feel that even this solution is not needed and could very well prove impractical', 'I-480 is deeply entrenched in the minds of people in the Bay Area', 'Even though it no longer exists, it would certainly cause some confusion if it were to be reincarnated', 'Perhaps more to the point, it would bring a lot of the old antagonism back to the surface from its days as the Embarcadero Freeway; antagonism that is best left in the past', 'From here, the suggestions grow more extreme and more complex', 'Renumber I-580 to something like I-305 and apply the I-580 designation to what is now I-238', 'While this suggestion makes a good deal of sense and is perfectly \"legal\" as far as the numbering scheme is concerned, it is something that would have made more sense to do in the early 1960s before I-580 was established in the first place', \"Don't get me wrong here; I think I-305 (or I-705) is a much better choice for that stretch of highway than I-580\", 'The cost of resigning all 76 miles of I-580 would be significant, to say the least', 'The overheads would have to be redone and all the shields (which cost Caltrans $25+ a pop) on all the on-ramps and along the freeway would have to be replaced', 'What is of more pressing concern is the confusion that such a renumbering would create', \"It's one thing if I-580 were to disappear altogether; it's another that it becomes a two mile long freeway right next to its former location\", 'The confusion that would be created by renumbering this 40+ year old freeway would be incredible - and costly', 'Getting rid of I-238 is not important enough to merit a solution like that', 'Scott Oglesby (\"Kurumi\") has suggested building another x-38 in the Bay Area; I-338', 'This is a one-way \"toll free\" freeway that ends one mile into the San Francisco Bay off of Fremont', 'This would legitimize (to an extent) I-238 and solve a very nasty traffic problem', 'However, I think there are those who may have a moral objection to sending Bay Area commuters to the bottom of San Francisco Bay, although I have a moral objection to not doing so', 'Nevertheless, this would probably not go over too well, especially with Bay Area commuters who may take a dim view to such a traffic solution', 'A sensible suggestion, and to me the only feasible one, would be to renumber I-238 to I-980', 'SR-24 could once again extend south to I-880 as it did before', 'The cost of replacing shields would be very minor and there would not be a lot of confusion since most of I-980 is marked either as \"To I-580\", \"To I-880\", or simply as \"SR-24 North', '\" My only objection, and this reaches to the crux of my argument, is that it simply is not worth doing; it is not worth changing I-238 to anything, especially since it is such a short highway', \"Then again, the more I think about it, the more I realize that transferring I-980 and restoring SR-24 makes a lot of sense, enough I'm sure to render my arguments moot\", \"Realistically (and in the end that's what counts), I think any Caltrans engineer would laugh his head off when told to change I-238\", \"There are many more solutions to this that people have come up with and I'll list a few more\", 'As mentioned in Mr', \"Rouse's email, there was a proposal to build a new Bay Bridge between I-380 on the west and Route 238 on the East Bay\", 'A quick glance at the map showed me that this would have been built across the widest part of the bay, making it less than feasible', 'This would have been nice, though, since it would have eliminated I-238, replacing it with I-380 and it would have helped Bay Area commuters', 'Some of the others did not seem so reasonable', 'I heard proposals by road buffs to have an I-3 in place of US 101 or to extend I-70 west',

nuclear capacity', 'That is one of the reasons why we are, in fact, in Iraq', \"And that's why our soldiers, when they fight and die there, are in fact serving the interests of the United States\",

willingness to actually hold together as a nation or split apart into a lot of balkanized pieces\", 'We are testing our willingness to actually hold on to something called the English language,

are much, much more significant than any that we've been discussing so far\", 'And so, yes, I have said dramatic things', 'And, yes, I am willing to do whatever is necessary to try to stop this piece

Diego, illegal immigrants are doing jobs that American citizens don't want, working on farms, in hotels, restaurants\", \"If you have your way and they all leave this country, who's going to fill those jobs\", 'HUNTER: Well, first, I disagree with that premise, because when they made the sweep on the Swift plants -- those were the meat- packaging plants in Iowa; took out some 850 people who were working there illegally several months ago -- there were American citizens lined up the next day to get their jobs back at 18 bucks an hour', 'And let me tell you, this is a disastrous bill', 'And John McCain is right in saying that this is a national security issue', 'And it is: border enforcement', 'Then the Hunter bill, which was signed by the president on the 26th of October, mandating 854 miles of double fence -- not that scraggly, little fence you show on CNN all the time, Wolf, that people get across so easily', 'If they get across my fence, we sign them up for the Olympics immediately', '(LAUGHTER)', \"We've got a big fence\", 'But 854 miles of double border fence was mandated to be constructed', 'Homeland Security has a billion bucks, cash on hand', \"It's been six months, and they've done 11 miles\", 'So this administration has a case of the slows', 'And I think they slowed the fence down so that they could come out with the amnesty at the same time, put the two together, and the Bush-McCain-Kennedy bill would then be accepted by conservatives and liberals alike', \"It's a bad bill\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Senator Brownback, what do you say about this notion of a pathway toward citizenship for these 12 million illegal immigrants who are in the country right now', 'Under what circumstances would you let them begin that path', \"BROWNBACK: I don't think you create any new paths to citizenship\", 'But I also think you allow them to be able to use paths that they would currently qualify for, and to be able to get in the back of the line', \"And that's part of leadership and getting something resolved\", 'I think, you know, we can go on a lot of slogans here', \"And I've been around this issue for a while\", 'I was in Congress in 1994, elected then', 'We did the first immigration bill I was involved in then in 1996', 'You know what', 'That was an enforcement-only bill in 1996', 'And we had 7 million undocumented here in the country then', \"We're at 12 million to 20 million now\", 'The point of saying that -- and my colleagues and people up here, everybody is concerned that we get something done and get something right', \"I think if you do exterior enforcement, border enforcement, you do aggressive interior enforcement, and then you work on a comprehensive solution interior, that's something that a lot of people are going to be upset with but that can work and move us forward\", \"And it's better than not doing anything\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'So you support this pending compromise

about you, Governor Thompson', \"THOMPSON: Wolf, the first thing you have to do is you've got to secure the border\", 'Securing the border is going to allow everything else to follow', 'But unless you secure the border, it is not right to give 12 million individuals who have illegal rights in this country status before that border is protected', 'There should be no amnesty', 'And this bill, no matter how you cover it, is an amnesty bill', 'And the people in this country do not believe in that bill', 'And they believe very much that the best hope for us to have a secure border, just like Congressman Hunter has been talking about and every other Republican up here', 'Have a secure border, then move on', \"But don't do it the other way\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', 'Congressman Paul, I want you to weigh in on this as well', \"I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- you voted to support that 700-mile fence along the border between the United States and Mexico\", 'Did you', 'PAUL: I did', 'BLITZER: What about Canada', 'Is there a need for a similar fence along the border between', 'PAUL: No', 'BLITZER:', 'the United States and Canada', 'PAUL: No, because that bill -- probably the fence was my weakest reason for doing that, but for other reasons, to enforce the law was important', 'And border security is important', \"And we talked about amnesty, which I'm positively opposed to\", 'But one thing that has not been mentioned here, which I think is very, very important: If you subsidize something, you get more of it', 'So we subsidize illegal immigration', 'We reward it by easy citizenship, either birthright or amnesty', 'But we force our states and our local communities to pay for the health care, to pay for the education', \"Why wouldn't they bring their families\", 'And because of our economic conditions, we do need workers', 'But if we had a truly free-market economy, the illegal immigrants would not be the scapegoat', 'We would probably need them, and they would be acceptable', 'But because of economic conditions, they have become the scapegoat', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: The other night, Sunday night, I

obvious', 'And part of our legislation, by the way, is a requirement to learn English', 'And by the way, 30 percent of the people who are in this country illegally never came across our borders, my friends', 'They overstayed their visas', \"That's why it has to be a comprehensive approach\", \"And I'm proud of the support of the president and his brother, Governor Jeb Bush, who was governor of

'Mayor Giuliani, there was some news here today', \"A Catholic bishop in Rhode Island said some words about your position on abortion, suggesting that it was similar to Pontius Pilate's personal opposition to Jesus Christ's crucifixion, but allowing it to happen anyway\", 'How does that make you feel when you hear words like that from a Catholic bishop', 'GIULIANI: Well, Catholic bishop -- any religion (inaudible)', \"BLITZER: That's the lightning that's having an effect on our system\", 'GIULIANI: I know', '(LAUGHTER)', \"I guess I'm here by myself\", \"Look, for someone who went to parochial schools all his life, this is a very frightening thing that's happening right now\", '(LAUGHTER)', 'But the reality is I respect, you know, the opinion of Catholic (inaudible) and religious leaders of all kinds', 'Religion is very important to me', \"It's a very important part of my life\", \"But ultimately, as (inaudible) been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law, I've got to make the decisions that I think are the right ones in a country like ours\", \"And my view on abortion is that it's wrong, but that ultimately government should not be enforcing that decision on a woman\", 'That is my view that I -- I consult my religion', 'I consult my reading of the Constitution', 'I consult my views of what I think are important in a pluralistic society, and the reality that we have to respect the fact that there are people that are equally as religious, equally as moral, that make a different decision about this, and should government put them in jail', 'BLITZER: You made, Governor Romney, this decision on abortion, opposing abortion, relatively recently', 'Why should conservatives out there, people who oppose abortion, believe you', 'ROMNEY: Well, people can look at my record', \"I'm not going to apologize for the fact that I became pro-life\", 'I served as governor', 'As I was governor, as we were debating cloning and as we were debating also embryo farming, I said Roe v', 'Wade has gone too far', \"I want to make it very clear that I'm pro-life\", 'People here in New Hampshire have seen that I fought for life', 'I fought also for traditional marriage, to keep taxes down, to have education in our schools that includes abstinence education', \"I've fought for English immersion in our schools\", \"They know that I've got conservative credentials\", \"And that's one of the things that brings me to this race\", \"But there's something bigger in conservatism that I don't think we've spoken about\", 'And that is that America is a land of opportunity', 'And our future is going to be far brighter than our past, not just as we overcome these challenges, but as we take advantage of the new opportunity of the 21st century', 'BLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor', \"Let's go back to Tom for the next question\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'FAHEY: (inaudible) do not believe in evolution', \"You're an ordained minister\", 'What do you believe', 'Is it the story of creation, as it is reported in the Bible or described in the Bible', \"HUCKABEE: It's interesting that that question would even be asked of somebody running for president\", \"I'm not planning on writing the curriculum for an 8th-grade science book\", \"I'm asking for the opportunity to be president of the United States\", \"But you've raised the question, so let me answer it\", 'In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth', \"To me, it's pretty simple\", 'A person either believes that God created this process or believes that it was an accident and that it just happened all on its own', 'And the basic question was an unfair question, because it simply asked us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed, in my view, whether there is a God or not', 'Well, let me be very clear: I believe there is a God', \"I believe there's a God who was active in the creation process\", \"Now, how did he do it and when did he do it and how long did he take, I don't honestly know\", \"And I don't think knowing that would make me a better or a worse president\", \"But I'll tell you what I can tell this country: If they want a president who doesn't believe in God, there's probably plenty of choices\", \"But if I'm selected as president of this country, they'll have one who believes in those words that God did create\", 'And as the words of Martin Luther, here I stand', 'I can do no other', 'And I will not take that back', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Governor, but I think the specific question is, do you believe literally it was done in six days and it occurred 6,000 years ago', 'HUCKABEE: No, I did answer that, Wolf', \"I said, I don't know\", \"My point is, I don't know\", \"I wasn't there\", '(LAUGHTER) But I believe, whether God did it in six days or whether he did it in six days that represented periods of time, he did it', \"And that's what's important\", 'But, you know, if anybody wants to believe that they are the descendants of a primate, they are certainly welcome to do it', \"I don't know how far they will march that back\", 'But I believe that all of us in this room are the unique creations of a god who knows us and loves us, and who created us for his own purpose', '(APPLAUSE)', \"BLITZER: Senator Brownback, you recently elaborated on your position on this, and I wonder if you'd want to spend 30 seconds and tell our audience out there where you stand on the issue of evolution\", \"BROWNBACK: I'd be happy to\", \"And it's interesting that we're doing this here at St\", \"Anselm's, who this -- that saint had a philosophy of faith seeking reason\", \"And that's the issue that's missing here, if I could highlight that point, is that I believe that we are created in the image of God for a particular purpose\", 'And I believe that with all my heart', \"And I'm somebody, I've had cancer in the past, I've had a season to really look at this and study it and think about the end of life\", \"And I am fully convinced there's a god of the universe that loves us very much and was involved in the process\", \"How he did it, I don't know\", \"One of the problems we have with our society today is that we've put faith and science at odds with each other\", \"They aren't at odds with each other\", 'If they are, check your faith or check your science, and we should have a discussion', 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'BROWNBACK: And we should engage faith and reason like St', 'Anselm did', 'BLITZER: Thank you', \"BROWNBACK: That's something we should do\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator Brownback', '(APPLAUSE)', \"Senator McCain, do you believe creationism should be taught alongside evolution in the nation's schools\", \"MCCAIN: No, I believe that that's up to the school districts\", 'But I think that every American should be exposed to all theories', \"But I can't say it more eloquently than Pastor Huckabee -- Governor Huckabee just did\", 'And I admire his description because I hold that view', \"The point is that the time before time, there's no doubt in my mind that the hand of God was in what we are today\", 'And I do believe that we are unique, and I believe that God loves us', 'But I also believe that all of our children in school can be taught different views on different issues', 'But I leave the curricula up to the school boards', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator, for that', 'Governor Romney, there was a recent poll here in New Hampshire', \"Ten percent said they wouldn't vote for you because you're a Mormon\", 'And last week, we saw that picture of that man who refused to shake your hand because you are a Mormon', 'What would you like to say to the voters out there tonight about your faith, about yourself and about God', 'ROMNEY: Well, President Kennedy some time ago said he was not a Catholic running for president, he was an American running for president', \"And I'm happy to be a proud member of my faith\", \"You know, I think it's a fair question for people to ask, what do you believe\", \"And I think if you want to understand what I believe, you could recognize that the values that I have are the same values you'll find in faiths across this country\", 'I believe in God, believe in the Bible, believe Jesus Christ is my savior', 'I believe that God created man in his image', 'I believe that the freedoms of man derive from inalienable rights that were given to us by God', \"And I also believe that there are some pundits out there that are hoping that I'll distance myself from my church so that that'll help me politically\", \"And that's not going to happen\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor, for that', 'Congressman Paul, you ran for president once before as a libertarian', 'What do you say about this whole issue of church and state and these issues that are coming forward right now', 'PAUL: Well, I think we should read the First Amendment, where it says, \"Congress shall write no law,\" and we should write a lot less laws regarding this matter', \"It shouldn't be a matter of the president or the Congress\", 'It should be local people, local officials', \"The state should determine so many of these things that we just don't need more laws determining religious things or prayer in schools\", 'We should allow people at the local level', \"That's what the Constitution tells us\", \"We don't need somebody in Washington telling us what we can do, because we don't have perfect knowledge\", \"And that's the magnificence of our Constitution and our republic\", \"We sort out the difficult problems at local levels, and we don't have, you know, one-case-fit- all\", 'Because you have a Supreme Court ruling, like on Roe v', 'Wade, it ruined it for the whole country', \"And that's why we shouldn't have it at a central level\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', \"Let's go back to another question from Tom\", 'FAHEY: This is for Mayor Giuliani', 'Sea levels around the world are rising', 'Average temperatures are increasing', 'A U', 'N', 'report written by scientists from 113 countries recently said that climate change is very likely man-made and may affect us for centuries to come', 'Is science wrong on global warming', 'And what, if any, steps would you take as president to address the issue of climate change', 'GIULIANI: I think we have to accept the view that scientists have, that there is global warming, and that human operation, human condition contributes to that', 'And the fact is that there is a way to deal with it and to address it in a way that we can also accomplish energy independence, which we need as a matter of national security', \"It's frustrating and really dangerous for us to see money going to our enemies because we have to buy oil from certain countries\", 'We should be supporting all the alternatives', 'We need a project similar to putting a man on the moon', 'That project started with Eisenhower', 'It was carried out by Kennedy and then Johnson and then Nixon', 'And that was two Democrats and two Republicans working (inaudible) Democrats working in the national interest', 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'Thank you, Mayor', 'I want Governor Romney to weigh in as well', \"There's a perception, at least among some, that Republicans are -- at least the Republican Party -- very close to big oil\", 'A lot of Americans are suffering now from the price of gasoline -- high price of gasoline', \"What do you say to the audience out there who believes that there's too much of an alliance, if you will, between the big oil companies and Republicans\", 'ROMNEY: Well, first of all, Rudy Giuliani is right, in terms of an Apollo project to get us to energy independent', 'And the effects of that on global warming are positive', \"It's a no-regrets policy\", \"It's a great idea\", 'Secondly, with regards to big oil, big oil is making a lot of money right now', \"And I'd like to see them using that money to invest in refineries\", \"Don't forget that when companies earn profit, that money's supposed to be reinvested in growth\", 'And our refineries are old', 'Someone said to me -- Matt Simmons, an investment banker down in Houston -- he said, \"Our refineries today are rust, with paint holding them up', '\"', \"And we need to see these companies, if they're making that kind of money, reinvest in capital equipment\", \"But let's not forget that where the money is being made this year is not just -- and throughout these years -- is not just in Exxon and Shell and the major oil companies\", \"It's in the countries that own this oil\", 'Russia last year took in $500 billion by selling oil', 'Ahmadinejad, Putin, Chavez -- these people are getting rich off of people buying too much oil', \"And that's why we have to pursue, as a strategic imperative, energy independence for America\", 'And it takes that Apollo project', 'It also takes biodiesel, biofuel, ethanol', 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'ROMNEY:', 'cellulosic ethanol, nuclear power, more drilling in ANWR', 'We have to be serious also about efficiency', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', \"ROMNEY: And that's going to allow us to become energy- independent\", 'BLITZER: Senator McCain, do you have a problem at this time with these oil companies making these huge profits', 'MCCAIN: Sure', 'I think we all do', 'And they ought to be reinvesting it', 'And one of the areas that they ought to be involved in is nuclear power', 'Nuclear power is safe', 'Nuclear power is green, does not emit greenhouse gases', 'Nuclear power is used on Navy ships which have sailed around the world for 60 years without an accident', 'And of course we ought to be investing in alternate energy sources', 'Recently there was a group of retired military officers who said that climate change and energy independence is a national security issue', 'It is', \"We've got to reduce our dependence on imported oil\", 'We can do it through a wide variety of alternative fuels', \"But we have to be serious about it and we're going to have to go to places where we have never gone before\", 'And nuclear power is one of the major issues, but also all kinds of ethanol as well', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator', 'Let me bring Congressman Paul back into this conversation', 'In 2005, President Bush signed an energy bill that provided billions of dollars in tax break subsidies to the oil companies, with the goal of boosting domestic production', 'At a time of these record profits, do you believe these companies need a helping hand from the federal government', \"PAUL: I don't think the profits is the issue\", \"The profits are OK if they're legitimately earned in a free market\", 'What I object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them R&D money', \"I don't think that should be that way\", 'They should take it out of the funds that they earn', \"But also, you can't discuss energy without discussing our foreign policy\", 'Why do we go to the Middle East', \"We know the oil is very important about the Middle East and why we're there\", 'Why did we, our government, help overthrow Mosaddeq in 1953', 'It had to do with oil', 'So, our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests', \"The profits, that's not the problem\", \"It's the problem that we succumb to the temptation to protect oil interests by literally going out and fighting wars over oil\", 'BLITZER: Governor Gilmore, you agree', \"GILMORE: I agree that if you make profits of the open marketplace, that that's an appropriate thing to do\", 'I also believe that they should be going in and putting this additional money into additional drilling, into additional exploration', \"But it's going to have to be bigger than that\", \"We're going to have to in fact look to all sources: ethanol, biomass, coal, clean coal, the opportunities for natural gas, and nuclear power\", 'And by the way, nuclear power will help this whole issue of global warming', 'And one more point in direct answer to your question: The Kyoto treaty was, in fact, fatally flawed', 'That was a treaty that in fact was going to basically just transfer our money directly to Russia for nothing, because they were going to get credits because simply that their economy had declined', \"The truth is, we're going to have to get a program in place, an international diplomatic answer, that is going to include every nation of the world in this entire project\", 'And that includes China and India', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', 'Let me bring Scott back for the next question', 'SPRADLING: Congressman Paul, a question for you', 'Most of our closest allies, including Great Britain and Israel, allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military', \"Is it time to end don't ask/don't tell policy and allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the U\", 'S', 'military', 'PAUL: I think the current policy is a decent policy', 'And the problem that we have with dealing with this subject is we see people as groups, as they belong to certain groups and that they derive their rights as belonging to groups', \"We don't get our rights because we're gays or women or minorities\", 'We get our rights from our creator as individuals', 'So every individual should be treated the same way', 'So if there is homosexual behavior in the military that is disruptive, it should be dealt with', \"But if there's heterosexual sexual behavior that is disruptive, it should be dealt with\", \"So it isn't the issue of homosexuality\", \"It's the concept and the understanding of individual rights\", 'If we understood that, we would not be dealing with this very important problem', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Governor Huckabee, I want you to weigh in as well', \"Do you believe it's time to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the United States military\", \"HUCKABEE: Wolf, I think it's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct\", \"I think that's what Congressman Paul was saying: It's about conduct; it's not about attitude\", \"But I'd like to ask you\", 'You said a moment ago that you were going to all give us a chance to deal with the issue of immigration', \"BLITZER: We're going to come back to that\", \"HUCKABEE: And I hope you'll do that\", 'BLITZER: We will', \"We'll come back to immigration\", 'HUCKABEE: You held us to it, and now I want to hold you to it, so', \"BLITZER: We're going to come back\", 'HUCKABEE:', 'if you could give us that opportunity', \"BLITZER: We're going to come back to immigration\", \"But right now, we're talking about allowing gays to serve openly in the military\", \"But you're opposed to that\", \"HUCKABEE: I just said I think it's a matter -- it's not -- you don't punish people for their attitudes; you punish them if their behavior creates a problem\", \"And it's already covered by the Uniform Code of Military Conduct\", \"BLITZER: So you wouldn't change existing policy\", 'HUCKABEE: What', \"BLITZER: You wouldn't change existing policy\", \"HUCKABEE: I don't think that I would\", \"I think it's already covered by the existing policy that we do have, in fact\", \"BLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, recently we've learned that several talented trained linguists -- Arabic speakers, Farsi speakers, Urdu speakers -- trained by the U\", 'S', 'government to learn those languages to help us in the war on terrorism, were dismissed from the military because they announced they were gays or lesbians', 'Is that, in your mind, appropriate', 'GIULIANI: This is not the time to deal with disruptive issues like this', 'Back in 1994 we went through this', 'And it created a tremendous amount of disruption', 'Colin Powell, I think, was still the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before he left at the beginning of the Clinton administration', 'He came to the view that this was a good policy', \"And I think in time of war, in a time where we're trying to deal with this transition to a new kind of warfare that we have to be fighting -- and we haven't gotten all the way there yet\", 'We need a hybrid army, we need to look at nation-building as part of what we have to teach our military', \"I don't think this would be the right time to raise these issues\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'GIULIANI: And I think we should rely on the judgment of our commanders in a situation like this', \"They know what's disruptive and what's not\", \"And at a time of war, you don't make fundamental changes like this\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor', \"Governor Romney, the mayor referred to the don't ask/don't tell policy, which was implemented during the Clinton administration, after Bill Clinton became president\", \"In 1994, you were quoted as saying that you advocated gays being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation's military\", 'The question to you is, do you still feel that way', \"ROMNEY: No, actually when I first heard of the don't ask/don't tell policy I thought it sounded awfully silly and didn't think that'd be very effective, and I turned out to be wrong\", \"It's been the policy now in the military for, what, 10, 15 years\", 'And it seems to be working', 'And I agree with what Mayor Giuliani said, that this is not the time to put in place a major change, a social experiment, in the middle of a war going on', \"I wouldn't change it at this point\", 'We can look at it down the road', 'But it does seem to me that we have much bigger issues as a nation that we ought to be talking about than that policy right now', \"BLITZER: Senator McCain, you've been involved in military matters virtually your whole life\", 'What do you say', 'MCCAIN: We have the best-trained, most professional, best- equipped, most efficient, most wonderful military in the history of this country', \"And I'm proud of every one of them\", '(APPLAUSE)', \"There just aren't enough of them\", 'So I have to rely on our military leadership, in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young Americans in combat as we speak', 'So I think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue', 'It is working, my friends', 'The policy is working', \"And I am convinced that that's the way we can maintain this greatest military\", 'As much as I revere the greatest generation, as much as I love my own generation, this is the very best', \"Let's not tamper with them\", 'BLITZER: Is there anyone here who believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve openly in the United States military', 'If you do, speak up now', 'Scott, go ahead with your question', 'SPRADLING: Gentlemen, last night, we asked Democrats, if they were elected, what role would they use former President Clinton', \"I'm not going to ask you that\", '(LAUGHTER)', \"But, Governor Thompson, I'd like to know, seeing as how you were a member of President Bush's Cabinet as health and human services secretary, how would you use George W\", 'Bush in your administration', 'THOMPSON: I certainly would not send him to the United Nations', '(LAUGHTER)', 'I believe George W', 'Bush has tremendous characteristics', \"He's very honest\", \"He's very straightforward\", 'I would put him out on a lecture series, talking to the youth of America about honesty, integrity, perseverance, passion, and serving the public', 'George W', 'Bush believes very much in public service, as does his father, as does his brothers, as does his mother', 'I think he could be a wonderful spokesperson, making sure that young people realize that public service is a very noble cause and something that young people should aspire to, like all the young people here on this campus should also have the opportunity to serve in public life', '(APPLAUSE)', \"BLITZER: Senator Brownback, same question to you: If you're elected president, what would you ask your predecessor to do\", 'BROWNBACK: Well, I would talk with him about it first, and I would ask him about it', 'I think he would probably take a position the way his dad did, saying, \"You know, I think you need to have your time in the limelight', 'And I will be willing to help out if you have a tragedy overseas', '\"', 'His father has been excellent, in the tsunami that hit Sri Lanka and other places, in helping fund-raising', \"He's been a wonderful ambassador in those sorts of situations\", \"And frankly, I think that's the right role for an ex-president\", \"And I really think, in many respects, President Clinton has not assumed the right role of an ex-president, where he's injected himself a lot more on policy issues that haven't been appropriate, and he really should defer more to the person that's in the job\", \"There's one person that's president at a time, and that's the way it should be\", 'BLITZER: Congressman Tancredo, I see you anxious to weigh in', 'TANCREDO: Thank you', 'Some time ago, in 2003 I think it was, that I got a call from Karl Rove, who told me that, because of my criticism of the president, I should never darken the doorstep of the White House', \"I have been so disappointed in the president in so many ways since his -- actually for the last several years, not just the immigration issue, but several other things, including the No Child Left Behind and the massive increase in government that we call prescription drug -- Medicare prescription drug, that I'm afraid I would have to tell the president of the United States -- I mean, as president, I would have to tell George Bush exactly the same thing Karl Rove told me\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', 'Governor Huckabee', '(APPLAUSE)', 'you served, as you reminded us, a long time as a governor, Republican governor of Arkansas', 'Your old job is now in Democratic hands', 'Here in New Hampshire, the GOP has suffered some significant losses as well', 'And the Republicans lost the majority in the House and the Senate, as you well know', \"Simple question: What's happened to the GOP\", \"HUCKABEE: Lost credibility, because we didn't do what we were hired to do\", \"When you're elected, you're hired to do a job\", \"You're hired to cut spending, lower taxes, bring more government back to the local people\", 'We did the polar opposite', 'And the people fired us', 'And I think, in many ways, though there were some good people that got caught up in the tsunami of the 2006 elections, the Republican Party, as a whole, deserved to get beat', \"We've lost credibility, the way we bungled Katrina, the fact that there was corruption that was unchecked in Washington, and the fact that there was a feeling that there was not a proper handling of the Iraqi war in all of its details, and the indifference to people pouring over our borders\", 'And let me just add this, Wolf', 'There are a lot of people for whom the immigration issue is like a lot of them', 'They see Washington not taking the kind of positions to build a fence, and they know that when they go to the airport to get on an airplane, they have to show photo I', 'D', \", they have to go through layers of security, and they don't understand why someone across an international border doesn't have to do the same thing\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'Thank you, Governor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Congressman Hunter, I want to just -- because he raised the issue -- he raised the issue of corruption', 'Do you think it would be appropriate for President Bush to pardon Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, who was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for his role in the CIA leak case', \"HUNTER: You know, I think, Wolf, to make a determination on that, you'd have to look at the transcript\", \"I'll tell you a couple of transcripts I have looked at, and that's the agents, Compean and Ramos, who were given 11 and 12 years respectively for stopping a drug dealer bringing 750 pounds of drugs across the border\", \"I've looked at their transcript; I would pardon Compean and Ramos right now\", '(APPLAUSE)', \"And let me say, with respect to what Mike said, we've got to bring back the Reagan Democrats to this party, because we need the Reagan Democrats for Republican leadership to work\", \"And we're going to have to get a good trade bill that brings jobs back

appeal process\", \"We've got to see what happens here\", 'GIULIANI: I think the sentence was way out of line', 'I mean, the sentence was grossly excessive in a situation in which, at the beginning,

when I was associate attorney general', 'I would see if it fit the criteria for pardon', \"I'd wait for the appeal\", 'I think what the judge did today argues more in favor of a pardon because',

who the leak was', 'ROMNEY: Hey, Wolf, can I explain', 'GIULIANI: And ultimately, there was no underlying crime involved', 'BLITZER: All right', 'ROMNEY: This is one of those situations where I go back to my record as governor', \"I didn't pardon anybody as governor, because I didn't want to overturn a jury\", 'But in this case, you have a prosecutor who clearly abused prosecutorial discretion

worth looking at that\", \"I will study it very closely if I'm lucky enough to be president\", \"And I'd keep that option open\", 'BLITZER: Senator', 'BROWNBACK: Yes', \"The basic crime here didn't happen\", 'What they were saying was that the identity of an agent', 'BLITZER: All right', 'Governor', 'BROWNBACK:', 'was revealed, but that agent has to be in the field for that to be a crime',

in chief would do, both in the halls of the American government, to bring the parties together, as well as on the desert sands of the Middle East to bring this conflict to a point in which we can safely bring our troops home', 'VAUGHN: Erin, thank you', \"Congressman Hunter, let's begin with you on that\", 'HUNTER: OK', 'Absolutely', 'The key to leaving -- and, incidentally, thank you for his service', 'And I want to let you know, my son', '(APPLAUSE)', 'I want to let you know that my son Duncan, the day after 9/11, joined the Marine Corps, quit his job, did two tours in Iraq', \"He's in Afghanistan right now\", \"First, I want you to know that it's worth it\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'What he did was worth it', 'And if we can achieve a country in Iraq that will not be an state sponsor of terrorism for the next 5 to 10 to 20 years, that will be a friend, not an enemy, of the United States, and will have a modicum of freedom, that is in the national interest of the United States, just like establishing a free Japan on the other side of the Pacific was in our interest after World War II, just like providing freedom and a protective shield for Salvador in Central America was in our interest', 'So what I would do, and what we need to do right now, and we are doing, is standing up the Iraqi army', \"There is 129 battalions of Iraqis that we've trained and equipped\", 'We need to start moving them into the combat zones where they displace the heavy American combat forces', 'Then we can pull our forces out', 'We can bring them home or send them wherever Uncle Sam needs them again', 'BLITZER: Thank you', \"HUNTER: That's how we leave Iraq the right way\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', \"Senator Brownback, I'd like you to weigh in\", 'BROWNBACK: If I could', \"And thank you for your family's service and what your brother did\", \"That's incredible and an incredible gift that he and your family have given us\", \"And I think you've identified the right thing\", \"It's not about leaving, and it's not about being defeated\", \"It's about getting the situation to a point that we can turn it over to Iraqis, and then us pull back from the front of the line\", \"That's why I'm putting forward tomorrow a bill, and this would be about a three-state solution in Iraq -- a Kurdish state, a Sunni state, a Shia state -- with Baghdad as the federal city, in a loose, weak, federated system; oil revenues equally divided\", \"And it's a bipartisan bill\", 'We will have bipartisan support', \"We've got to pull together here to win over there\", 'BLITZER: Senator', \"BROWNBACK: And we can do this together, but we haven't put yet forward, this administration, a political solution that will be long- term and durable\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'Thank you, Senator', \"BROWNBACK: That's what we've got to do\", 'BLITZER: Senator McCain, is that a good idea, to divide up Iraq into three separate', \"BROWNBACK: It's not divided\", \"It's three states, one country\", \"MCCAIN: It's not -- ma'am, I want to tell you thank you for your brother's service and sacrifice to our country\", \"We are proud of you and your endurance, and we're proud of your sacrifice\", \"This war -- I'm going to give you a little straight talk\", 'This war was very badly mismanaged for a long time', 'And Americans have made great sacrifices, some of which were unnecessary because of this management of the war -- mismanagement of this conflict', 'I believe we have a fine general', 'I believe we have a strategy which can succeed, so that the sacrifice of your brother would not be in vain, that a whole 20 million or 30 million people would have a chance to live a free life in an open society, and practice their religion, no matter what those differences are', 'And I believe that if we fail, it will become a center of terrorism, and we will ask more young Americans to sacrifice, as your brother did', 'This is long and hard and tough', 'But I think we can succeed', 'And God bless you', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator', 'Jennifer, go ahead with your next question', 'VAUGHN: Cynthia Kiernan is here with us tonight', 'Cynthia, you live in Merrimack, New Hampshire', 'QUESTION: Yes', 'VAUGHN: You can go ahead and stand up', 'And you brought your husband with you', 'QUESTION: Yes', 'Michael served in Iraq', 'And we have a question regarding the government in Iraq', 'Everyone\\'s talking about, \"Pull our troops out; pull our troops out', '\" Well, considering they\\'ve lived under a dictatorship for the last 30 years or so, what are we going to do to make sure they have a government in place before we do pull our troops out and they\\'re able to help themselves', \"Otherwise, we're just putting them in a position to accept another terrorist leader\", '(APPLAUSE)', 'VAUGHN: Congressman Paul', \"PAUL: Well, we've had four years to do this and it hasn't worked\", 'The biggest incentive for them to take upon themselves the responsibility is just for us to leave', \"PAUL: We don't need to lose 100 men and women every month, more than a thousand per year\", \"And so, if you want it done, you want them to take over, you've got to give them an incentive\", 'So I think we should immediately stop patrolling the streets', \"That's a policeman's job\", \"It's not the work of the Army\", \"We're not fighting a military battle\", \"We're in a different type of warfare right now\", 'So the sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can make sure that no more Americans will die', 'We have a lot of goodness in this country', 'And we should promote it, but never through the barrel of a gun', 'We should do it by setting good standards, motivating people and have them want to emulate us', \"But you can't enforce our goodness, like the necons preach, with an armed force\", \"It doesn't work\", 'Woodrow Wilson was telling us about that, in promoting democracy a long time ago', 'BLITZER: Thank you', \"PAUL: It doesn't work and we have to admit it\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Let me bring Mayor Giuliani in', \"I don't know if you consider yourself a neocon, but go ahead and respond to what Congressman Paul said\", '(LAUGHTER)', 'GIULIANI: Michael, thank you very much for serving us, and thank your family for their tremendous sacrifice', \"I'd like to put it in a slightly different context\", \"I believe that your service for us and your brother's sacrifice is one of the reasons we're safe now in the United States\", 'I believe that this terrorist war began way back in the 1970s', 'They attacked us in 1993 in New York', 'They attacked us again in 2001 in a horrible way', \"And I believe that what we're doing in Iraq, if we can get it right, is going to help reduce the risk for this country\", 'And if we get it wrong, this is going to be much, much worse for us', \"And part of what we have to do and we haven't done right is take on that responsibility of nation-building\", 'We created that responsibility for ourselves when we overthrew Saddam Hussein, which we did very effectively', 'It was one of the greatest military actions in American history, overthrowing Saddam Hussein', \"But we didn't accomplish the second step\", 'People can only embrace democracy when they have an orderly existence', 'And we have to help provide that', \"We didn't want that role, but it is our role\", 'And we have to train our military to do it', 'We should probably have an IraqStat program, in which we measure how many people are going to school, how many factories are open, how many people are going back to work', 'We had to get into the nitty-gritty of putting an orderly society together in Iraq', 'It is not too late to do it', \"And I'd just like to ask, I'd just like to ask one question I didn't get to ask before, when you said, if General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things aren't going well, what are we going to do\", 'But suppose General Petraeus comes back in September and reports that things are going pretty well', 'Are we going to report that with the same amount of attention that we would report the negative news', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Jennifer, go ahead', 'VAUGHN: Kysa Crusco is here with us tonight', 'Hi, Kysa', 'QUESTION: Hi', 'VAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire', 'You are an attorney', 'QUESTION: I am', 'VAUGHN: OK', \"What's your question tonight\", 'QUESTION: My question is whether you believe that a conservative platform can also include a conservationist agenda', 'And, if so, how', 'VAUGHN: Governor Gilmore', 'GILMORE: The question was whether or not a conservative agenda can also have a conservation agenda', 'And I think that it can', 'Certainly, when I was governor of the state of Virginia, we worked very hard in order to make Virginia a beautiful place and a place where we could in fact be welcoming to people, and that it would be a nice community for people to visit', 'But at the end of the day, this is going to come down to the question of whether or not conservatism can match up with energy independence, which is a national security issue and it is a fundamental part of conservatism', 'Conservatism means empowering people', 'It means cutting taxes and controlling government spending', 'It also means national security', 'And national security means a lot of different elements right at this time', \"And we're discussing some of them tonight\", 'And I can assure the people who are families here tonight, their young people, young men and women who are on the battle lines, and people who are committing their lives, they are in fact serving the national interests of this country in a time of major crisis', 'The other two issues, however, would also go to the issue of the immigration issue, which I want to come back to at some point, but also energy independence', 'And energy independence also can serve the interests of conservation', 'BLITZER: All right', 'GILMORE:', 'particularly if we use nuclear power and other clean forms of energy so that we can in fact make this a clean society that is also safe and secure for the nation', 'BLITZER: Thank you very much, Governor', 'Congressman Tancredo, do you believe true conservatives should be doing more to protect the environment', 'TANCREDO: Yes', \"I think that that's absolutely imperative, and I think so because, frankly, you've got a conservative model to pick from\", 'I mean, you know, Teddy Roosevelt, after all, put this stamp on that -- the whole issue of conserving the environment, creating the national parks system', \"There's nothing anti-conservative about doing anything like that\", 'And you know what else you can do in order to foster that', 'You do it through conservative principles', 'You make it profitable for people to do exactly that, to put -- to make conservation an issue that hits people in the pocketbook, or they can profit by getting involved in conservation', \"That's one way the free market really works perfectly\", \"We've seen it happen all over the world\", 'We can see and we will put conservation to work -- conservation practices to work in the United States through conservative principles', 'We have a lock on that', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', 'Jennifer, go ahead', 'VAUGHN: Good evening, sir', 'You are Doug Hall', 'QUESTION: Yes', \"VAUGHN: I understand that you're the town moderator for Chichester, New Hampshire\", 'QUESTION: I am', \"VAUGHN: What's your question tonight\", 'QUESTION: I know a business owner in northern New Hampshire who was on vacation in Spain last year for about three weeks', 'While he was there, he had to buy refills for prescription drugs, brand name drugs, and he discovered in buying those drugs that he could buy his refills there for $600 less than he could buy them here in New Hampshire', 'So since then, he said he is going to take a trip over to Spain and get his vacation paid for to buy his drugs', 'My question to you is, why is this', 'And if you are elected president, is there anything you would do to address it', 'VAUGHN: Mayor Giuliani', 'GIULIANI: What I would do is change the whole model that we have for health insurance in this country', \"The problem with our health insurance is, it's government and employer-dominated\", \"People don't make individual choices\", \"It's your health\", 'You should own your health insurance', 'We should be giving you a major tax deduction, $15,000 for a family, so you can buy your own health insurance', \"If you buy health insurance for $8,000 or $9,000, you'll save $5,000 or $6,000 in tax- free money\", 'Then we should have a health savings account, in which you can put some money aside to pay for your ordinary medical expenses', 'Health insurance should become like homeowners insurance or like car insurance', \"You don't cover everything on your homeowners policy\", \"If you have a slight accident in your house, if you need to refill your oil with your car, you don't cover that with insurance\", \"But that is covered in many of the insurance policies, because they're government-dominated and they're employer-dominated\", 'What the Democrats suggested on this stage two nights ago was socialized medicine', 'There was a man in California who said to me, \"When we make health insurance free, just wait and see how expensive it will become', '\"', 'And the reality is that we need a free market', 'We need 100 million Americans making different decisions', 'It will bring down the cost of health insurance', 'It will bring down the cost of prescription medicines', 'Free-market principles are the only things that reduce costs and improve quality', 'Socialized medicine will ruin medicine in the United States', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Congressman Hunter, you live on the border, San Diego, not far from Mexico', 'A lot of Americans go to Mexico to buy cheaper prescription drugs', 'A lot of Americans in this part of the country go to Canada to buy cheaper prescription drugs', 'What should we here in the United States be doing to bring down the price of prescription drugs', 'HUNTER: And, Wolf, the fabulous Grampy, my father-in-law, who lives with us, is one of those people that trots down and goes through the border at Yuma and does that', 'So lots of Americans do that', \"But here's what happens\", \"Eighty percent of the new drugs and new inventions that save our lives, that help preserve the lives of the relatives of everyone who's in this particular room right now, 80 percent of those inventions are made in the United States because we have free enterprise, where people can go out, invest\", \"And maybe they drill three dry holes in trying to produce a good drug that will save somebody's lives\", 'Then maybe they hit the jackpot and they produce something that will save people and help their health', 'They then recover their money in the United States', 'And what they have left over, in terms of market, they put into the Third World', 'But Third World countries like Mexico could never provide the amount of money that it takes to make those inventions', 'Otherwise, they would', \"Here's what we have to do: We need to be able to buy our health care insurance across state lines, Wolf\", 'Right now the same single policy that can be purchased in Long Beach for $73 costs $334 in New Jersey', 'The states lock up the insurance industry', \"They won't let Americans buy across state lines, just like they do everything else\", \"If we're able to do that\", 'BLITZER: Thank you', 'HUNTER:', \"we're going to bring down the cost of health insurance\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', \"Jennifer, let's go back to another question\", 'VAUGHN: Also on the topic of health care tonight, this is a question from our wmur', 'gather', 'com blogger, who is Joshua Williamson', 'Joshua asks, \"Millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the current state of our health-care system, and U', 'S', 'employers are at a disadvantage due to the high cost of health insurance', 'What would you do to fix the health-care system', 'And would you support implementing a single-payer system, in which the government acts as the insurer in order to save enough money to cover the millions of uninsured and to lower premiums for the rest of the U', 'S', 'population', '\"', \"Governor Thompson, let's have you weigh in on that\", \"THOMPSON: You know, I've been here for two debates\", 'We never had one question on health care', 'Thank that person for talking about health care', 'Number one, we spend $2 trillion on health care', \"That's 16 percent of the gross national product\", 'Ninety-three percent of the cost of health care goes into waiting until after you become sick', 'Only 7 percent of the money is used to keep you well in the first place', 'We got to completely transform the health care system, make it a wellness system and make it a prevention system', 'Secondly, we have 125 million Americans that have one or more chronic illnesses', 'In order to change this, we have to educate the American people about tobacco, about diabetes, about cardiovascular and about obesity', \"You do that, you'll be able to change health care\", 'The third thing, 25 percent of Americans use two-thirds of the cost of health care', 'If you manage those diseases, you can reduce that down to 50 percent and save lots of money', 'Fourth, information technology, electronic medical record, a patient bill of rights and be able to have e-prescribing', \"And if you do that, you're going to be able to save billions of dollars\", 'If you just go paperless, ladies and gentlemen, you will save 10 percent of the cost of health care', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor, very much', 'Governor Romney, you worked with the Democrats in the state legislature in your home state, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts', 'You worked with Ted Kennedy to come up with a program that provides some -- mandates, in effect, the individual health insurance coverage', \"Some conservatives say this is simply big government, more liberal involvement in people's lives\", 'What do you say to those conservatives who are critical of the way you handled this issue in Massachusetts', 'ROMNEY: Well, I want to talk to the people, not just to those conservatives who are critical', \"And the people of this country recognize they've got some real concerns in health care\", 'And I learned after I was governor a short bit of time -- I talked to people and they say, \"If I lose my job, I\\'m going to lose my insurance', 'And my insurance premiums are getting higher and higher and higher', '\"', 'And I talked to small-business people, and they said, \"I can\\'t afford the policies anymore', '\"', 'And we said, \"You know, we\\'ve got to find a way to get everybody insured', 'And the last thing we want is to have the government take over health care, because anything they take over gets worse, not better', '\"We\\'re going to turn to Washington, because Washington makes a mess', 'Washington is all talk', 'And we said, \"We need to find a way to get everybody in our state insured with private insurance', '\"', 'The half a million who didn\\'t have insurance, all the people worried that if they lost their job, they\\'d lose insurance, we said, \"We\\'ve got to find a way to get them insured without raising taxes, without a government takeover', '\"', \"And that's what we did\", 'It relies on personal responsibility', 'This is a big issue for this country', 'Every Democrat up there is talking about a form of socialized medicine, government takeover, massive tax increase', 'We have to stand up and not just talk about it', \"I'm the guy who actually tackled this issue\", 'We get all of our citizens insured', 'We get people that were uninsured with private health insurance', 'We have to stand up and say, \"The market works', 'Personal responsibility works', '\"', \"We're going to have insurance for all of our citizens they can afford, that's theirs, that's portable\", 'They never have to worry about losing it', \"That's the answer\", 'Thank you', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Jennifer, go ahead', 'VAUGHN: Thank you, Wolf', 'Next question comes from you, sir', 'Your name is Max Latona', 'QUESTION: Yes, it is', 'VAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire', 'What do you do for a living, sir', 'QUESTION: I teach philosophy here at Saint Anselm College', \"VAUGHN: And what's your question tonight\", 'QUESTION: My question is a simple one: In your opinion, what is the most pressing moral issue facing this country today', \"And, if you're elected president, how would you address that issue\", 'VAUGHN: Governor Huckabee, you are an ordained minister', 'What is the most pressing moral issue in this country', \"HUCKABEE: Well, it looks like I'm getting all the moral questions tonight, and I guess that's a good thing\", '(LAUGHTER)', \"That's better than getting the immoral questions\", \"So I'm happy to get those\", '(LAUGHTER)', 'HUCKABEE: I really believe that, if you define it a moral issue, it is our respect, our sanctity and our understanding of the value of every single human life', 'Because that is what makes America a unique place on this planet: We value every life of an individual as if it represents the life of us all', 'Many of us who are pro-life, quite frankly, I think, have made the mistake of giving people the impression that pro-life means we care intensely about people as long as that child is in the womb', \"But beyond the gestation period, we've not demonstrated as demonstrably as we should that we respect life at all levels, not just during pregnancy\", \"We shouldn't allow a child to live under a bridge or in the backseat of a car\", \"We shouldn't be satisfied that elderly people are being abused and neglected in nursing homes\", 'It should never be acceptable to us that people are treated as expendable -- any people', 'But the unique part of our country is that we elevate and we celebrate human life', 'And if you look at us with a contrast to the Islamic jihadists, who would strap a bomb to the belly of their own child, march him into a crowded room, set the detonator and kill innocent people, they celebrate death; we celebrate life', \"It's the fundamental thing that makes us unique, and it keeps us free\", 'I pray we never, ever abandon that basic principle', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Governor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Mayor Giuliani, what is the most pressing moral issue in America today', 'GIULIANI: I think the governor is correct', 'I would put it in maybe a slightly different way', 'We have great gifts in this country that come to us from God', 'We have a country in which we have freedom of religion, freedom of press, freedom for the individual, the right to elect our own officials', \"And the reality is that in some of the world, much of the world, that doesn't exist\", 'And I think the challenge for our generation is going to be, are we able to share those gifts in an appropriate way with the rest of the world', 'If we can bring along the Middle East, if we can bring along those countries that are presently our enemies, and get them to see the values of these ideals, if we have the moral strength to be able to explain it to them in the way Ronald Reagan was able to do with communism, then we can end up having the peace that we want', 'And we should not -- we should never become pessimistic about this', 'Remember, this is the country that was at war with Vietnam just a short while ago', \"We're friends now\", 'BLITZER: All right', 'GIULIANI: This was a country that was at war with Japan, Italy and Germany a generation ago', \"They're some of our best friends today\", 'We have great resources in this country', \"And watching the strength of America when we believe in the essential ideals that we have -- they're not just American ideals; they come from God\", \"And I think it's our moral obligation to find the right way to share that with the rest of the world\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Mayor', '(APPLAUSE)', 'Congressman Paul, what is the most pressing moral issue in the United States right now', 'PAUL: I think it is the acceptance just recently that we now promote preemptive war', \"I do not believe that's part of the American tradition\", 'We, in the past, have always declared war in defense of our liberties or go to aid somebody', 'But now we have accepted the principle of preemptive war', 'We have rejected the just war theory of Christianity', \"And now, tonight, we hear that we're not even willing to remove from the table a preemptive nuclear strike against a country that has done no harm to us directly and is no threat to our national security\", 'I mean, we have to come to our senses about this issue of war and preemption and go back to traditions and our Constitution and defend our liberties and defend our rights, but not to think that we can change the world by force of arms and to start wars', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Thank you, Congressman', 'Senator Brownback really wants to weigh in, as well', 'BROWNBACK: Thank you', 'And thank you for the question from a philosopher', \"I think it's the life issue clearly, and I'm pro-life and I'm whole life\", \"And one of the things I'm the most -- the proudest about our party about is that we've stood for life\", \"We've been a party that has stood for a culture of life\", 'And it was in our platform in 1980, and it continues today', \"And with that respect -- and I have respect for my other colleagues -- that's why I don't think we can nominate somebody that's not pro-life in this party, because it is at our core\", 'We believe that every life is beautiful, is sacred, is a child of a loving God from natural -- from conception to natural death', \"And that applies not only here and in the womb, it applies to somebody that's in poverty, it applies to the child in Darfur\", 'And that philosophy, being pro-life and whole life, is something I think can really help move us forward as a country and as a party', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Senator, if Rudy Giuliani got the Republican presidential nomination, would you be able to support him', 'BROWNBACK: That question came up at the first debate, and I stated that this is something that we as a party have struggled with', 'I have great respect for the mayor', \"I don't think we're going to nominate somebody that's not pro-life\", 'BLITZER: Would you be able to support him', 'BROWNBACK: I can support and will support the nominee of our party', 'But our party has stood on principles', \"It's a party of principles\", \"It's not a party of personalities\", 'We lose when we walk away from our principles', \"That's when we have trouble\", \"And that's the country wants us to do\", 'BLITZER: Thank you, Senator', 'BROWNBACK:', 'is to stand for principles', '(APPLAUSE)', 'BLITZER: Jennifer, go ahead', 'VAUGHN: Next question tonight from Neil Capano', 'Neil, you are an airline agent', 'QUESTION: Yes, I am', 'VAUGHN: You live in Manchester, New Hampshire', 'You have a question tonight for Governor Romney', 'QUESTION: Yes, I do', 'First of all, I would like to thank all of you for joining us tonight in beautiful Manchester, New Hampshire', 'However, my question is for Governor Romney exclusively', \"You've been accused

traffic over the past month, having been searched for more than six times as often as second-place Bush', 'So if the press were going purely by public demand, there might be even more Trump coverage',

'His admitted drug use to the U', 'S', 'Army, who rejected him, that should have been in the system', 'So he should have -- if we had, you know, a system -- if we improved the system, he would have been rejected from buying the gun in the gun store', \"Now, the other problem is, there's the other loophole, right\", \"There's the records loophole, but there is the loophole that would allow him to go to a gun show, or on the Internet to buy a gun\", 'And we need to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from doing that', \"It's crazy that we have a system -- you know, we have a system that responsible gun owners get a background check, and the option to avoid one is available for anybody who doesn't want to do it\", \"I mean, it's a -- it's a crazy system\", \"WALLACE: But doesn't the NRA have a point: if you're going to expand the background check and cover more people, don't you have to make sure the mental health information gets into the system, because otherwise it's kind of a waste of time\", 'KELLY: They absolutely have a point', 'I mean, they are -- they are right on that issue', 'I mean, we need to encourage states to include the mental health records', 'After Virginia Tech, for instance, Virginia was one of the worst states on this', \"And after what happened in Virginia Tech, they're actually really, really good about getting those records to the federal government\", \"So I'm encouraging -- I mean, I would love to be able to work with the leadership of the NRA and work with the United States Senate and the House to make sure we get those records in the system and then close the gun show and private seller loophole, like 92 percent of Americans want, like 74 percent of NRA members want\", 'WALLACE: The big hold-up in the Senate now over the background check is that if you do expand it to include gun shows and private sales, do the people who sell the guns in those cases have to keep private records', 'Keep records of those sales', \"And as you well know, the NRA says the danger is that if they have to do what licensed dealers have to do and keep those records, that could be used to form a national registry and somewhere down the line, that could be used to confiscate people's guns\", 'How do you respond to that', \"KELLY: Well, I just don't think it's logical\", 'I mean, right now, when you buy a gun in a gun store like I did, you know, there is a record that remains with the gun store', \"It's not a record with the federal government\", 'It is not a record that is going to one day lead to a national registry, or gun confiscation', 'So the system currently works with the federally licensed firearms dealers', 'There is no reason that same system cannot work with the gun show, and the private seller', 'But, of course, this is an issue for many, you know, some Republican senators', \"And it's certainly something that could be worked on\", \"I mean, we've got a lot of smart members in the Senate and I think they can figure out a compromise on this issue\", 'WALLACE: Finally, Arizona officials this week released a lot of records about the shooter, Jared Loughner, the man who shot Gabby and 18 others',

would have gotten some mental health -- you know, gotten an evaluation', \"And when he -- you know, certainly in his case, when he's taking medication, he's not as psychotic as without the

about making it easier for authorities, a school or a family to commit a Jared Loughner, an Adam Lanza, the Newtown shooter before they got access to guns and acted out in this horrible way', 'But, that seems to have been forgotten in all of the debate about gun control', \"KELLY: Well, I don't know if it has been forgotten\", 'I mean, certainly, you know, the debate in the Senate is going to --

important component of this\", \"I mean, to address mental illness in this country, to get those records of mental illness into the system and then to make sure that there isn't a loophole where the

including women and Muslims', 'Question -- what message is the pope sending about what he is going to do', 'WUERL: I think his message is a very clear one, that you bear witness with words, but you also bear witness with actions', \"And I think what he is trying to say to all of us is, if we really are trying to introduce people to the gospel, if we are really trying to tell believers how important the gospel is, can't you do that as well, maybe even better, with actions as well as words\", \"I think that's what he's trying to do\", 'WALLACE: There is a widespread sense that the church has problems, governance problems', 'That there is corruption inside the church, that there are turf wars', 'One of the first things the pope has to deal with is that secret investigative report about the Vatican leaks', 'Why did the cardinals believe that Pope Francis was the right man to clean things up', 'WUERL: I think there are probably a couple of ideas that were going around as we were talking about who might be the next pope, who would be the best person to choose', 'One, when we talk about the church, we also want to make sure that we distinguish it from just the operation of the Vatican', 'I think we were concerned about who will keep the momentum of the new evangelization going and who will keep this energy the church is seeing among many of our young people around the world', 'Who will keep that going', 'At the same time, somebody has to address the administration of the Holy See', \"Somebody has to take a look at what is working and what isn't working\", \"I can't

someone better than Pope Francis', 'The credibility he brings to whatever he decides, in the Vatican, is going to be enormous', 'But, in the meantime, he is keeping the focus on the rest of the church, where there is an awful lot of good going on', 'WALLACE: But on the inside game, how aggressive a reformer, how revolutionary, if you will, do you expect Pope Francis to be -- not on doctrine -- but on changing the way the church does business', \"WUERL: Well, perhaps we're seeing signs of it in the fact that he hasn't moved in to the papal residence, that he's chosen to stay in the residence where we all were for the conclave\", \"Maybe he's simply saying, there are going to be a lot of changes, we're going to get back to something that will be a little more direct, and maybe contact with the pope will be a little easier\", 'And that was one of the things that we cardinals talked about -- the need to find ways in which there is a lot more communication between the rest of

hysteria to help control themselves inside and the generation of threats, especially towards this new, more conservative, less concession-minded government in South Korea to see what they can extract', 'As they have now for 20 years since this nuclear issue began', 'WALLACE: You know, one of the concerns here, and that does seem to be different, Bill, is that North Korea seems to be ignoring the warnings from its main, far and away biggest sponsor, China, which had warned the regime and Kim Jong-un not to make these threats against the United States, not to make these threats against South Korea, and yet it proceeded with them', 'Why would Kim risk alienating the country that literally, you know -- talk about biting the hand that feeds you, that literally feeds its people', \"KRISTOL: Well, China never seemed to really have been willing to pull the trigger and stop feeding his people or stop providing other kinds of aid to North Korea, so they've gotten away

weapons and not just accept them as inevitable', \"And I think in a post-Cold War world, we don't know, the North Korean regime could be ten or 20 years from now, and they could have many more missiles and many more nuclear weapons and they could be proliferating them\", \"I'm not sure we'll find them or the Israelis will know whether they have proliferated\", \"Don't we want to get serious

as if the court will strike down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, on sort of federalism grounds, and', \"WALLACE: But it's a state issue, not a federal issue\", 'KRISTOL: Right, and the federal government in a way is putting a thumb on the scale by preferring traditional marriage to states that -- by preferring states that have chosen traditional marriage over states that have chosen same

is going to do', \"WALLACE: All right, we'll go down the list\", 'Down the row here and see', 'But, one of the points, Mara, that several justices made, is that public opinion is changing so quickly

sense, could the supporters of same sex marriage be victims of their own success', 'LIASSON: Yes', 'I think they could and I actually think the best outcome for Democrats and even proponents of same sex marriage is if Prop 8 is upheld in California, but there is no sweeping constitutional finding that same sex marriage is legal all over the country, because', 'WALLACE: Well, if Prop 8 is upheld, that means that same sex marriage is banned', \"LIASSON: No, I'm sorry, Prop 8 is -- the lower court ruling is upheld, which means Prop 8 is overturned\", 'WALLACE: OK', \"LIASSON: I'm sorry about that\", 'But if they want to in California, right now they could back and put up Prop 8', \"2, legalizing same sex marriage and it would probably pass, it is a lot more meaningful and profound to kind of adjudicate divisive social issues by voters and legislators, not unelected justices, and I think that it's going to be more lasting political change if you do it at the ballot box\", \"It also means you're not going to have this huge backlash and I agree with Bill, I don't think the court is going in the direction of legalizing same sex marriage on the national constitutional basis\",

moving in the direction of support for same sex marriage, especially among young people, 70, 80 percent of all people of all persuasions, under the age of 35, 40, support same sex marriage as a legal right', 'But the polls show that Republicans still overwhelmingly oppose it, only 27 percent in one poll, I saw, support same sex marriage', 'So, where does the Republican Party go', 'You have an awful lot of your base still very much opposes this', 'But you can see the pendulum swinging for the country', \"GILLESPIE: Chris, I don't see the Republican Party or most Republicans, obviously, changing in terms of believing that marriage is between one man and one woman\", 'I do think that in the context of this debate, as in so many other debates, Republicans have been cast in the negative, you know - in the negative to say we are opposing something as opposed to talking about what most Republicans are for', 'Most Republicans are also for the benefits of marriage in the legal system, that are afforded, the protections like, for example, visitation - hospital visitation rights or survivorship benefits and I think you will hear more Republicans making that point, that we can do those things without having the government sanction same sex marriage', 'WALLACE: But looking at the polls, and, particularly, looking at where younger people are going, would you have any problems in 2016, with a Republican Party platform saying that marriage is between a man and a woman', \"GILLESPIE: I wouldn't have any problem with that\", 'I think one of the questions is, I believe the platform right now calls for a federal constitutional amendment to ban it', 'You know, there may be a debate about that', 'WALLACE: (inaudible) ban same sex marriage', 'GILLESPIE: Yeah, to ban it',
